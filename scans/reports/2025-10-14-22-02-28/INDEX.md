## Key Findings

### Compliance Score
**23% ADR-001 Compliant**

- ✅ 23% Correct (database, some endpoints)
- ❌ 77% Non-Compliant (transformations, API, types)

### Critical Issues
1. **984 lines** of transformation code violating "zero transformation" principle
2. **4 files** dedicated to case conversion (should be deleted)
3. **18 API violations** returning camelCase instead of snake_case
4. **Duplicate type systems** (Client vs Shared)

### Top Priority Actions
1. Disable `ENABLE_RESPONSE_TRANSFORM` middleware
2. Fix auth routes (highest traffic)
3. Update API type definitions
4. Delete transformation utilities

## Report Metrics

### Scan Coverage
- ✅ Server routes: 19 files scanned
- ✅ Shared types: 12 files scanned
- ✅ Client services: 9 files scanned
- ✅ Transformation utilities: 6 files found
- ✅ API responses: 50+ endpoints analyzed

### Confidence Level
**HIGH** - 95% confidence in findings

- Automated grep/glob searches
- Manual code review of critical paths
- Line-by-line analysis of transformation utilities
- Cross-referenced with ADR-001 documentation

## Conclusion

This scan identified **systematic violations** of ADR-001 across the codebase. The violations are **fixable** with a structured 4-phase migration plan over 5-7 days.

**Key Takeaway**: The codebase has transformation logic that contradicts the architectural decision to use snake_case everywhere. Removing this logic will improve performance, reduce maintenance burden, and align with PostgreSQL industry standards.
