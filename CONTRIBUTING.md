Thank you for your interest in contributing to Restaurant OS!

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork locally
2. **Set up** the development environment: `pnpm i && pnpm -w dev`
3. **Create a feature branch**: `feat/your-feature-name`
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Test your changes**: `npm run typecheck && npm test`
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] ESLint checks pass (zero errors allowed)
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

- [ ] **Database Changes** (if applicable):
  - Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
  - Wrote SQL with idempotent patterns (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
  - Included migration tracking: `INSERT INTO supabase_migrations.schema_migrations...`
  - **Synced Prisma schema:** `./scripts/post-migration-sync.sh`
  - Committed both migration and updated `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - PR validation passed (automated checks on schema sync)

  - Never edited deployed migrations (created new ones instead)
  - See [CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md](./docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md) for full workflow

## Important Guidelines

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Every database operation and API endpoint must enforce tenant isolation
- **Security**: Never commit secrets or API keys
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features (current coverage baseline: ~23.47%)
- **Performance**: Keep main bundle under 100KB
