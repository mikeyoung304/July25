### What We've Accomplished Recently
✅ **Security Hardening**: CSRF protection, auth improvements, payment validation
✅ **Performance Optimization**: Bundle reduced 76% (347KB → 82KB)
✅ **Database Performance**: 12 indexes applied, 50-60% query improvement
✅ **Architecture Improvements**: Order state machine, WebSocket V2

## 🚨 Priority Focus Areas (Next Sprint)

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization System** 🔐
**Why Critical**: Currently using demo tokens - need real user management
**Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: Required for multi-tenant production

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add user registration/login flows
- [ ] Create restaurant staff management
- [ ] Add permission middleware for all routes
- [ ] Implement session management

#### Roles Needed:
- Super Admin (platform level)
- Restaurant Owner
- Restaurant Manager  
- Kitchen Staff
- Service Staff
- Customer

---

### 2. **Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors** 🐛
**Why Critical**: 519 errors (non-blocking, down from 670+)
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: Type safety, fewer bugs

#### Most Common Issues:
- Type mismatches in API responses
- Missing properties in interfaces
- `as any` type assertions (50+ instances)
- Mismatched TypeScript versions (5.8.3 vs 5.3.3)

#### Quick Wins:
```bash
# See all errors
npm run typecheck

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
```

---

### 3. **Real Payment Integration** 💳
**Why Critical**: Currently in Square Sandbox only
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: Can accept real payments

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Switch to Square Production credentials
- [ ] Add PCI compliance measures
- [ ] Implement payment reconciliation
- [ ] Add refund workflow
- [ ] Create payment audit trail
- [ ] Add tip handling UI

---

### 4. **Testing & Quality Assurance** 🧪
**Why Critical**: Tests are failing/timing out
**Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: Confidence in deployments

#### Current Issues:
- Pre-commit hooks failing
- Tests timing out after 2 minutes
- Missing integration tests
- No E2E tests

#### Priority Tests Needed:
- Order flow E2E
- Payment processing
- WebSocket stability
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Kitchen display updates

---

### 5. **Production Infrastructure** 🏗️
**Why Critical**: Need proper deployment pipeline
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: Reliable deployments

#### Infrastructure Needs:
- [ ] Redis for WebSocket scaling
- [ ] CDN setup (CloudFlare/Vercel)
- [ ] SSL certificates
- [ ] Environment management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring (Sentry/DataDog)
- [ ] Backup strategy

---

## 📊 Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
1. **Remove 316 console.log statements**
   ```bash
   grep -r "console.log" client/src server/src | wc -l
   ```

2. **Hard-coded values to fix**:
   - Tax rate (8%) - make configurable
   - Restaurant ID fallbacks
   - Localhost URLs
   - Timeout values

3. **Memory/Performance**:
   - WebRTCVoiceClient.ts (1263 lines) needs splitting
   - LocalStorage cleanup (runs hourly, should be more frequent)
   - Memory monitoring overhead

### Medium Priority
- Consolidate cart systems (UnifiedCartContext duplicates)
- Remove abandoned KDS implementations
- Standardize snake_case vs camelCase
- Add missing error boundaries

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Sprint (2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Foundation
**Monday-Tuesday**: Fix critical TypeScript errors
- Focus on Order and Payment types
- Remove `as any` assertions
- Fix API response types

**Wednesday-Friday**: Implement basic RBAC
- User roles and permissions
- Protected routes
- Staff management UI

### Week 2: Production Prep
**Monday-Tuesday**: Testing framework
- Fix pre-commit hooks
- Add critical integration tests
- Setup E2E with Playwright

**Wednesday-Thursday**: Infrastructure
- Setup Redis
- Configure monitoring
- Create deployment pipeline

**Friday**: Load testing & optimization
- Test with 100+ concurrent users
- Optimize any bottlenecks
- Document performance baseline

## 💡 Quick Wins (Can Do Today)

### 1. Remove Console Logs (30 min)
```bash
# Remove all console.logs
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs sed -i '' '/console\.log/d'
```

### 2. Fix Tax Rate (15 min)
```typescript
// Add to restaurant settings
const TAX_RATE = restaurant.settings?.tax_rate || 0.08;
```

### 3. Add Health Monitoring (30 min)
```typescript
// Add endpoint for uptime monitoring
app.get('/health/detailed', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    version: '6.0.0',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    memory: process.memoryUsage(),
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
});
```

### 4. Setup Error Tracking (20 min)
```bash
npm install @sentry/node @sentry/react
# Add DSN to .env
# Initialize in app startup
```

## 📞 Questions to Answer

1. **Timeline**: When do you need to be in production?
2. **Scale**: How many restaurants/orders per day initially?
3. **Features**: Which features are MVP vs nice-to-have?
4. **Team**: Who will maintain this in production?
5. **Budget**: Infrastructure budget per month?
