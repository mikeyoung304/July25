## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (5 minutes)

**Run on Staging Database:**

```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
cd /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0
supabase db push

# Option B: Direct SQL execution
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251029145721_add_seat_number_to_orders.sql
```

**Verify Migration:**
```sql
-- Check column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'orders' AND column_name = 'seat_number';

-- Expected: seat_number | integer | YES

-- Check indexes created
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'orders' AND indexname LIKE '%seat%';

-- Expected: 2 indexes (idx_orders_table_seat, idx_orders_seat_number)
```

**Rollback if needed:**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251029145721_rollback_add_seat_number_to_orders.sql
```

---

### Step 2: Backend Deployment (10 minutes)

**Files to Deploy:**
1. `shared/contracts/order.ts`
2. `server/src/models/order.model.ts`
3. `server/src/services/orders.service.ts`
4. `supabase/migrations/20251029150000_add_seat_number_to_create_order_rpc.sql`

**Build and Deploy:**
```bash
cd /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0/server
npm run build
# Deploy built files to your hosting (Vercel/Railway/etc.)
```

**Run RPC Migration:**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251029150000_add_seat_number_to_create_order_rpc.sql
```

**Verify API:**
```bash
# Test endpoint accepts seatNumber
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-restaurant-id: your-restaurant-id" \
  -d '{
    "items": [{"name": "Test Item", "price": 10, "quantity": 1}],
    "type": "dine_in",
    "tableNumber": "5",
    "seatNumber": 2
  }'

# Should return 200 with order including seat_number: 2
```

---

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment (10 minutes)

**Files to Deploy:**
1. `client/src/pages/components/PostOrderPrompt.tsx` (NEW)
2. `client/src/pages/components/SeatSelectionModal.tsx`
3. `client/src/pages/hooks/useVoiceOrderWebRTC.ts`
4. `client/src/pages/ServerView.tsx`

**Build and Deploy:**
```bash
cd /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0/client
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/etc.
```

**Verify UI:**
- [ ] Open ServerView in browser
- [ ] Select a table
- [ ] SeatSelectionModal appears
- [ ] Select Seat 1
- [ ] Place voice order
- [ ] PostOrderPrompt appears with "Add Next Seat" and "Finish Table" buttons
- [ ] Click "Add Next Seat"
- [ ] Seat 1 shows green checkmark ✅
- [ ] Select Seat 2 and repeat

---

### Step 4: Integration Tests (5 minutes)

**Run E2E Tests:**
```bash
cd /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0
npx playwright test tests/e2e/multi-seat-ordering.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

**Expected Results:**
- Main test suite: 8 tests should pass
- Edge cases: 4 tests (placeholders - may skip)
- Payment integration: 2 tests (placeholders - may skip)

**If tests fail:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API responses in Network tab
3. Check database for seat_number values
4. Review deployment logs

---

### Step 5: Smoke Testing (5 minutes)

**Manual Test Checklist:**

**Scenario: Happy Path**
- [ ] Navigate to Server View
- [ ] Click Table 5 on floor plan
- [ ] Seat selection modal opens with 4 seats
- [ ] Click Seat 1
- [ ] Click "Start Voice Order"
- [ ] Add items via voice: "Soul Bowl and Green Juice"
- [ ] Click "Submit Order"
- [ ] PostOrderPrompt appears
- [ ] Shows: "Seat 1 order has been sent to the kitchen"
- [ ] Shows: "1 of 4 seats ordered"
- [ ] Progress bar at 25%
- [ ] Click "Add Next Seat"
- [ ] Seat selection modal reopens
- [ ] Seat 1 has green checkmark badge ✅
- [ ] Progress banner: "1 of 4 seats ordered"
- [ ] Click Seat 2
- [ ] Repeat order process
- [ ] After submission, shows "2 of 4 seats ordered"
- [ ] Click "Finish Table"
- [ ] Success toast appears
- [ ] Returns to floor plan

**Scenario: Edge Cases**
- [ ] Can order for non-sequential seats (Seat 1, then Seat 3)
- [ ] Can click on already-ordered seat (allows re-ordering)
- [ ] "Finish Table" available from both PostOrderPrompt and SeatSelectionModal
- [ ] Canceling seat selection preserves ordered seats state

**Scenario: Database Verification**
```sql
-- Check orders were created with seat numbers
SELECT id, order_number, table_number, seat_number, created_at
FROM orders
WHERE table_number = '5'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Should show orders with seat_number = 1, 2, etc.
```

## Post-Deployment Verification ✅

### Database Health
- [ ] Migration applied successfully
- [ ] Indexes created and functional
- [ ] No data corruption
- [ ] Rollback script tested (optional)

### API Health
- [ ] Orders accept `seatNumber` parameter
- [ ] Orders without `seatNumber` still work (backward compatible)
- [ ] Validation rejects invalid seat numbers
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive

### Frontend Health
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Accessible (keyboard navigation works)

### Integration Health
- [ ] Voice orders include seat_number
- [ ] Kitchen display receives orders (seat numbers pending KDS update)
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] No regressions in existing features

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### 1. Kitchen Display Seat Numbers
**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Impact:** Kitchen staff won't see seat numbers on order cards yet
**Workaround:** None (optional enhancement)
**Fix:** Create KDS_001 task for Phase 1.5 or Phase 2

### 2. Integration Tests Blocked
**Status:** Waiting for deployment
**Impact:** Cannot run full E2E tests until deployed
**Workaround:** Manual smoke testing
**Fix:** Run tests immediately after deployment

### 3. Real-time Seat Status
**Status:** Not implemented (Phase 3 feature)
**Impact:** Seat status doesn't update in real-time across devices
**Workaround:** Refresh page to see updates
**Fix:** Phase 3 will add real-time synchronization

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found:

**Step 1: Rollback Database (30 seconds)**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251029145721_rollback_add_seat_number_to_orders.sql
```

**Step 2: Rollback Backend (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Redeploy previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 -- server/
npm run build && deploy
```

**Step 3: Rollback Frontend (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Redeploy previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 -- client/
npm run build && deploy
```

**Total Rollback Time:** ~5 minutes

---

## Success Criteria

### Deployment is successful if:
- [x] Database migration applied without errors
- [x] API accepts and stores seat_number
- [x] UI shows seat ordering workflow
- [x] No critical bugs reported
- [x] No regressions in existing features
- [x] At least 6/8 main tests pass

### Green Light for Phase 2:
Once the above criteria are met, Phase 2 can begin immediately.

---

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders to Notify:
- [ ] Development team (deployment complete)
- [ ] QA team (ready for testing)
- [ ] Product team (feature available)
- [ ] Restaurant staff (training may be needed)

### Deployment Notes to Share:
- Multi-seat ordering now enabled
- Servers can order for individual seats at tables
- "Add Next Seat" workflow guides servers through table
- Seat numbers stored in database for future enhancements
