# Claude Commands

Prompt templates for Claude Code to handle common software development tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains prompts that help Claude Code work through software engineering tasks systematically. Each template provides a structured approach for specific development scenarios.

## Available Commands

### 1. Experiment-Driven Development (`01_experiment_driven_development.md`)

A learn-from-failure approach to implementing code changes. Tracks attempts and learnings through an iterative process.

**Use for:**
- Complex features requiring exploration
- Bug fixes with unclear root causes
- Performance optimizations
- Experimental refactoring

**Structure:**
- Goal setting with impact focus
- Code analysis and planning
- Implementation tracking with success/failure logs
- Iterative improvement cycles

### 2. Generate Codebase Context (`02_generate_codebase_context.md`)

Creates comprehensive documentation files (like `llms.txt`) that provide complete context about a codebase.

**Use for:**
- Onboarding documentation
- Codebase reference materials
- Pre-refactoring analysis
- AI assistant context

**Output includes:**
- File purposes and relationships
- Function signatures with parameters
- Architecture diagrams
- Code conventions
- Data formats

### 3. Analyze GitHub Issue (`03_analyze_github_issue.md`)

Analyzes GitHub issues and creates implementation plans before coding begins.

**Use for:**
- New issue assessment
- Implementation planning
- Stakeholder alignment
- Risk evaluation

**Process:**
1. Review issue details
2. Examine codebase
3. Create feature branch
4. Develop implementation plan
5. Request approval

### 4. Create GitHub Issue (`04_create_github_issue.md`)

Creates well-structured GitHub issues with varying detail levels based on complexity.

**Use for:**
- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- Architecture proposals
- Improvement suggestions

**Detail levels:**
- **MINIMAL**: Simple bugs or clear features
- **MORE**: Standard issues with technical details
- **A LOT**: Major features or architectural changes

**Features:**
- Repository convention research
- Best practices integration
- Stakeholder analysis
- Proper formatting and cross-references

### 5. Resolve PR Comments (`05_resolve_pr_comments.md`)

Systematically addresses all PR feedback, comments, and requested changes.

**Use for:**
- Code review feedback
- Multiple PR comments
- Pre-merge cleanup
- Review response management

**Workflow:**
1. Research - Find all comments and feedback
2. Planning - Prioritize and track with TodoWrite
3. Implementation - Address each item
4. Verification - Test and validate changes

**Features:**
- Parallel processing for independent changes
- Comment priority classification
- GitHub API command examples
- Resolution tracking

## Usage

Templates can be used as slash commands or copied directly:

```bash
# As slash command
/research Create OAuth authentication feature

# Or copy template content and replace placeholders
```

## Template Structure

Most templates include:
- Clear objectives
- Step-by-step processes
- Decision criteria
- Output formats
- Usage examples

## Best Practices

1. Select templates based on task type and complexity
2. Provide complete context when using templates
3. Follow all phases in multi-step workflows
4. Use TodoWrite for complex task tracking
5. Run tests and linting after changes

## Contributing

When adding templates:
- Focus on specific use cases
- Include clear documentation
- Provide examples
- Test thoroughly
- Keep formatting consistent

## Customization

- Adapt templates to match team conventions
- Save project-specific versions in `.claude/commands/`
