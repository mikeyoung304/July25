# Generate Codebase Context

Create llms.txt with:
- Main goals for each file from high level
- All functions with params and types
- Concise explanations of functions
- ASCII map of connections between files
- Conclusions about structure
- Code style guide
- Data format documentation
- Analysis from veteran developer perspective

Keep it DRY and comprehensive.
