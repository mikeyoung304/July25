# UI Implementation Workflow

## From Figma to React
1. Extract design tokens from Figma
2. Map to existing UI components
3. Check Shadcn UI components first
4. Implement with React/Tailwind
5. Ensure responsive behavior
6. Verify pixel-perfect accuracy

## Standards
- Use existing components when possible
- Follow project patterns
- Maintain TypeScript types
- Test all states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Quality Checks
- Compare against Figma for accuracy
- Test with different content lengths
- Verify responsive breakpoints
- Check dark mode support
- Validate performance
