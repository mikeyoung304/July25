# Experiment-Driven Development

Create /experiments/[feature].md with:

## Goal
[Impact-focused description]

## Research
[Code analysis findings]

## Plan
[Surgical implementation approach]

## Attempts
### Attempt 1
- Implementation: [what you did]
- Result: [success/failure]
- Balance: -$100 (if failed) or +$1000 (if succeeded)
- Learning: [insights gained]

Track success ($1000 bonus) or failure (-$100 penalty).
Update plan based on learnings and iterate.
