# Context: KDS Feature
- This feature handles the real-time display of kitchen orders.
- The primary component is `KDSOrderCard`.
- State is managed via `RestaurantContext` and Supabase real-time subscriptions.
- Key Goal: Ensure high performance and zero re-renders for non-updated order cards.

## Implementation Status

### Completed ✅
- **KDSOrderCard Component**: Fully implemented with TypeScript
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - React.memo wrapper to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Memoized elapsed time calculations
  - Status colors defined outside component to prevent object recreation
  - JSDoc comments documenting performance considerations
- **Test Coverage**: 8 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Order number and table display
  - Status badge rendering
  - Order items with quantities, modifiers, and notes
  - Dynamic button states based on order status
  - Event handler callbacks
- **Component Atomization**: Refactored into modular, reusable components:
  - **Atoms**: StatusBadge, ElapsedTimer, OrderNumber, TableLabel, ItemQuantityName, ModifierList, AlertNote, StatusActionButton
  - **Molecules**: OrderHeader, OrderMetadata, OrderItemsList, OrderActions
  - **Benefits**: Maximum reusability, easier testing, consistent UI patterns

### TDD Process
- ✅ Red Phase: Initial test written and failed
- ✅ Green Phase: Tests passing with working implementation
- ✅ Refactor Phase: Performance optimizations applied
- ✅ Atomization Phase: Component broken down into reusable pieces

### Next Steps
- Implement real-time order updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Add animation transitions for status changes
- Create KDSLayout component for grid/list view modes
- Add sound notifications for new orders
- Implement order filtering and sorting
