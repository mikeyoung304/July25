# Technical Assessment - Restaurant OS Status

Luis, here's the real state of the system as of January 2025.

## What Actually Works

### 1. Core Architecture
- Unified backend on 3001 - your design is implemented and stable
- Frontend on 5173 with Vite
- WebSocket on same port for real-time
- Supabase for data persistence
- Shared types module preventing type mismatches

### 2. Kitchen Display System
- Orders show up in real-time
- Status updates work (new → preparing → ready)
- Sound notifications trigger correctly
- Grid/list view toggle works
- Performance is solid with debounced updates

### 3. Order Flow
- Create order via API → Get order number → Save to DB → Broadcast via WebSocket
- Order numbers generate correctly (YYYYMMDD-0001 format)
- Multi-tenant isolation working via restaurant_id

### 4. Customer Ordering
- Menu browsing works at `/order/:restaurantId`
- Cart persists to localStorage
- Basic Square payment form exists
- Order confirmation page shows order details

## What's Broken/Half-Baked

### 1. Voice Ordering - MOSTLY FAKE
```typescript
// This is the actual "AI" parsing right now:
const parsedOrder = {
  items: [{
    name: 'Soul Bowl',
    quantity: 1,
    price: 12.99
  }],
  confidence: 0.85
};
```
- Transcription works (OpenAI Whisper)
- But order parsing is hardcoded
- Always returns "Soul Bowl" regardless of input

### 2. Database Issues
- Code references tables that don't exist:
  - `voice_order_logs`
  - `order_status_history`
- No migrations for these tables
- Code doesn't fail because errors are swallowed

### 3. Menu ID Mapping Complexity
- Frontend uses numeric strings (101, 201, etc.)
- Database uses UUIDs
- Manual mapping service required
- Easy to break if not careful

### 4. Payment Integration
- Square form exists but not fully wired
- No payment status tracking
- Order completes even if payment fails
- No refund capability

### 5. Missing Customer Features
- No order status tracking after placement
- No estimated ready times
- No notifications (SMS/email)
- WebSocket only broadcasts to kitchen, not customers

## Problems We Hit & Solutions

### 1. Web Vitals Blank Page (July 2025)
**Problem**: Page loaded then went blank after splash
**Cause**: `import { reportWebVitals } from 'web-vitals'` - This export was removed in v5
**Fix**: Removed the import, monitoring service already handled it correctly

### 2. Port 3002 Ghost References
**Problem**: Old microservice architecture references everywhere
**Solution**: 
- Added `npm run verify:ports` script
- Grep check in package.json prevents commits with 3002
- Still finding occasional references in docs

### 3. TypeScript Shared Types
**Problem**: Duplicate type definitions causing mismatches
**Solution**: Created shared package, but...
**Issue**: Build order matters, shared must build first

### 4. Environment Variable Confusion
**Problem**: Multiple .env files (root, client, server)
**Solution**: Single .env in root, but...
**Gotcha**: Frontend vars need VITE_ prefix or they don't load

### 5. WebSocket Connection Handling
**Problem**: Connection drops caused lost orders
**Solution**: Reconnection logic + order sync on reconnect
**Still TODO**: Queue offline orders and replay

## Performance Reality Check

### Good
- Initial load: ~2.5s
- Order create to kitchen display: <500ms
- WebSocket latency: ~50ms local
- Bundle size: 285KB gzipped

### Bad
- No code splitting on routes
- Loading ALL orders (no pagination)
- Kitchen display re-renders too much
- Memory leak in WebSocket handlers (event listeners not cleaned up)

## Security Status

### Implemented
- JWT auth via Supabase
- Restaurant isolation via RLS
- OpenAI keys server-side only
- Input validation on API routes

### Missing
- Rate limiting on expensive endpoints
- File upload validation (menu upload accepts anything)
- CORS too permissive (allows all origins in dev)
- No request signing for webhooks

## Developer Experience

### What Works
- `npm run dev` starts everything
- Hot reload reliable
- TypeScript catches most issues
- Error messages generally helpful

### Pain Points
- Tests take forever (Vitest + Playwright)
- Build times getting slow (~45s)
- Logs too verbose, hard to find issues
- No staging environment

## Technical Debt Inventory

1. **Hardcoded voice parsing** - Biggest lie in the system
2. **Missing database tables** - Code expects them but they don't exist
3. **No error boundaries** - One component crash kills whole page
4. **WebSocket memory leaks** - Listeners pile up over time
5. **No monitoring** - Flying blind in production
6. **Menu ID mapping** - Fragile abstraction layer

## The Real TODO List

### Critical
1. Implement actual AI order parsing
2. Create missing database tables
3. Fix WebSocket memory leaks
4. Add customer order tracking

### Important
1. Pagination for order lists
2. Error boundaries on key pages
3. Payment flow completion
4. Basic monitoring/alerting

### Nice to Have
1. Code splitting
2. Service worker for offline
3. Push notifications
4. Order analytics

## Honest Assessment

**What's Solid**: The core architecture works. Orders flow from customer to kitchen reliably. The unified backend was the right call.

**What's Sketchy**: Voice ordering is mostly fake. Payment integration incomplete. No customer visibility after ordering.

**Biggest Risk**: The hardcoded voice parsing. When someone discovers every voice order is "Soul Bowl", credibility dies.

**Quick Wins Available**:
1. Add the missing DB tables (30 min)
2. Customer order status page (2 hours)
3. Fix WebSocket cleanup (1 hour)
4. Basic pagination (2 hours)

**Time Bombs**:
1. Memory leak will crash after ~1000 orders
2. No payment verification = free food exploit
3. Menu ID mapping breaks easily

The foundation is solid, but several features are theater props rather than real implementations. The kitchen display is the most complete feature. Everything else needs work to be production-ready.
