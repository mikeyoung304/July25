# Moved to Canonical Documentation

This page has been consolidated into the canonical docs.

- Canonical: [Authentication Architecture](./docs/AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md#authentication-architecture-v60)
- Original preserved at: docs/archive/legacy-root/2025-10-15_AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md

Rationale: single source of truth with evidence-verified content.
