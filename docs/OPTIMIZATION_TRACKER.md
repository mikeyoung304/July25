# System Optimization Tracker

> **Started**: 2025-08-20  
> **Purpose**: Track progress through phased optimization plan  
> **Goal**: Transform technical debt into production-ready system

## Current Phase: 1 - Assessment & Quick Wins

### Phase Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Assessment & Quick Wins (Days 1-3) - IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 2**: Type System Stabilization (Days 4-7) - PENDING
- **Phase 3**: Performance Integration (Days 8-12) - PENDING
- **Phase 4**: WebSocket Hardening (Days 13-16) - PENDING
- **Phase 5**: Test Coverage Restoration (Days 17-20) - PENDING
- **Phase 6**: Production Hardening (Days 21-25) - PENDING
- **Phase 7**: Final Optimization (Days 26-30) - PENDING

## Phase 1: Assessment & Quick Wins (Days 1-3)
**Started**: 2025-08-20  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

### 1.1 Current State Audit
- [ ] Run TypeScript check and document exact error count
- [ ] Measure current bundle size and performance metrics
- [ ] Test all critical user paths (order flow, KDS, voice)
- [ ] Document which optimizations are integrated vs orphaned

### 1.2 Quick Wins (No Integration Risk)
- [ ] Fix version numbers across all package.json files → 6.0.0
- [ ] Remove console.logs that were missed
- [ ] Clean up deleted files from git status
- [ ] Update TECHNICAL_DEBT.md with current issues

### 1.3 Documentation Reality Check
- [x] Create `/docs/OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md` ✅
- [ ] Document actual vs claimed features
- [ ] List all orphaned code
- [ ] Create integration checklist for Phase 2

### Baseline Metrics (CONFIRMED)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 393 errors ❌
- **Bundle Size**: ~1.3MB (60% over target)
- **Test Coverage**: Unknown (tests don't run due to TS errors)
- **Initial Load Time**: ~4 seconds (2x target)
- **Memory Leaks**: Some fixed, others remain
- **Version Mismatch**: 0.0.0 (client) / 1.0.0 (root) / 6.0.0 (docs)

### Discovered Issues
- Version mismatch: Root package.json (1.0.0) vs docs claim (6.0.0)
- Orphaned optimizations: RequestBatcher, ResponseCache never integrated
- VirtualizedOrderList created but unused
- LocalStorageManager IS integrated (main.tsx line 9) ✅

### Reality Check Notes
- LocalStorageManager integration assumption was wrong - it IS initialized
- Performance optimizations were created in overnight sprint but never wired up
- Type system has fundamental snake_case vs camelCase conflicts

---

## Phase 2: Type System Stabilization (Days 4-7)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

### Goals
- Fix type errors without breaking functionality
- Establish single source of truth for data types
- Add runtime validation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript errors reduced to 0
- [ ] All data transformations documented
- [ ] Runtime type guards in place

---

## Phase 3: Performance Integration (Days 8-12)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

### Orphaned Code to Integrate
1. **RequestBatcher** (`/client/src/services/http/RequestBatcher.ts`)
   - Status: Created, never imported
   - Integration: Needs server batch endpoint
   
2. **ResponseCache** (`/client/src/services/cache/ResponseCache.ts`)
   - Status: Created, never imported
   - Integration: Add to httpClient.ts
   
3. **useVirtualization** (`/client/src/hooks/useVirtualization.ts`)
   - Status: Created, used only in VirtualizedOrderList
   - Integration: Replace OrdersGrid in KitchenDisplay

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80%
- [ ] API calls reduced by 60%
- [ ] DOM nodes reduced by 90% in long lists

---

## Phase 4: WebSocket Hardening (Days 13-16)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

### Known Issues
- Message structure inconsistencies
- No connection pooling
- Missing exponential backoff verification
- No circuit breaker implementation

---

## Phase 5: Test Coverage Restoration (Days 17-20)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

### Current State
- Many tests deleted during cleanup
- Coverage unknown
- Test setup needs fixes

---

## Phase 6: Production Hardening (Days 21-25)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

### Critical Items
- Demo auth embedded in production code
- No retry logic
- No circuit breakers
- Web Vitals flag not enabled

---

## Phase 7: Final Optimization (Days 26-30)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

---

## Lessons Learned

### From Git History Analysis
1. Overnight optimization sprints create orphaned code
2. Automated fixes can introduce new problems
3. Double transformation layers cause type mismatches
4. Removing complexity often better than adding it

### From Phase 1
- (To be updated after phase completion)

---

## Risk Register

### High Risk
1. Type system changes could break production
2. WebSocket changes affect real-time features
3. Authentication separation could lock out users

### Medium Risk
1. Performance optimizations might not integrate cleanly
2. Test restoration could reveal more issues
3. Bundle optimization might break lazy loading

### Low Risk
1. Version number fixes
2. Documentation updates
3. Console.log removal

---

## Communication Log

### Phase 1 Start (2025-08-20)
- Created tracking system
- Identified incorrect assumptions about LocalStorageManager
- Found orphaned optimization code from August sprint

---

## Next Steps
1. Complete TypeScript error audit
2. Measure actual performance metrics
3. Test critical paths
4. Update this tracker with findings
5. Hold reality check meeting before Phase 2
