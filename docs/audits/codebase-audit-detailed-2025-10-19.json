Good infrastructure exists (EnterpriseErrorHandler, guards in WebSocket/AuthContext) but inconsistently applied. Critical production issues: hardcoded tax rate, missing timeouts, no transaction support, silent audit failures. Recommend immediate fixes for payment and order services before production."
