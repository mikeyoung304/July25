  restaurant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES restaurants(id),
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

describe('Test Routes', () => {
  it('should return hello message', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/test/hello')

```markdown
| notes | text | No | - | Additional order notes |
```
6. Run drift check again:
```bash
npm run docs:drift:schema
# Should pass now
```

**What You Learned:**
- How drift detection works
- Importance of documentation
- CI automation benefits

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

### 6.1 Environment Variables

**Mistake:** Forgetting VITE_ prefix on client variables
```bash
❌ API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
✅ VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Why It Matters:** Client won't have access to variable, causing "undefined" errors

**How to Avoid:**
- Always use VITE_ prefix for client vars
- Run `npm run env:check`
- Check browser console for undefined vars

---

### 6.2 Multi-Tenancy

**Mistake:** Forgetting to filter by restaurant_id
```typescript
❌ const orders = await db.select().from('orders');
✅ const orders = await db.select().from('orders')
                      .where('restaurant_id', restaurantId);
```

**Why It Matters:** Security vulnerability - users see other restaurants' data

**How to Avoid:**
- ALWAYS include restaurant_id filter
- Use RLS policies as defense-in-depth
- Review "Git Patterns" document for examples

---

### 6.3 Database Migrations

**Mistake:** Editing already-applied migrations
```bash
❌ Edit supabase/migrations/20250101_initial.sql  # Already applied!
✅ npx supabase migration new fix_issue           # Create new migration
```

**Why It Matters:** Migrations are immutable - editing causes inconsistencies

**How to Avoid:**
- Never edit applied migrations
- Create new migration to fix issues
- Use migration versioning properly

---

### 6.4 WebSocket Memory Leaks

**Mistake:** Not cleaning up connections
```typescript
❌ useEffect(() => {
     const ws = new WebSocket(url);
     setInterval(ping, 30000);  // Leak!
   }, []);

✅ useEffect(() => {
     const ws = new WebSocket(url);
     const interval = setInterval(ping, 30000);
     return () => {
       ws.close();
       clearInterval(interval);
     };
   }, []);
```

**Why It Matters:** Memory grows unbounded, crashes application

**How to Avoid:**
- Always return cleanup function from useEffect
- Clear all intervals/timeouts
- Close WebSocket connections

---

### 6.5 Authentication Bypass

**Mistake:** Not validating JWT tokens properly
```typescript
❌ if (req.headers.authorization) {
     // User is authenticated!
   }

✅ const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
   const user = await validateJWT(token);
   if (!user) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
```

**Why It Matters:** Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized access

**How to Avoid:**
- Always validate JWT tokens
- Check expiration
- Verify signature
- Use authentication middleware

---
