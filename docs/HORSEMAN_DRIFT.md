# Architectural Drift Assessment Report
## Restaurant OS v6.0.3 - The Horseman of Drift

---

## Executive Summary

The Restaurant OS codebase exhibits significant architectural drift across multiple dimensions, revealing a system that has evolved through rapid iteration cycles without consistent architectural governance. While the application remains functional and has achieved production-ready status (8/10 rating), the accumulated drift presents substantial technical debt that impacts maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity.

### Key Findings
- **67 archived documents** representing abandoned architectural decisions
- **Multiple concurrent implementations** of core features (WebSocket services, cart systems, error boundaries)
- **Naming convention chaos**: snake_case vs camelCase war persists despite documentation claiming resolution
- **23 class-based components** in a codebase claiming to be "functional React"
- **Configuration sprawl** across 9 separate config files with overlapping concerns
- **33 JavaScript files** remaining in a "TypeScript strict" codebase

### Risk Assessment: **MODERATE-HIGH**
The system functions but requires significant refactoring to align with stated architectural principles.

---

## 1. Documentation vs Reality Gap

### Claimed Architecture (CLAUDE.md)
```
"TypeScript strict mode throughout"
"Unified backend on port 3001"
"Single Implementation: WebRTC + OpenAI Realtime API only"
"ONLY use UnifiedCartContext - no separate cart providers"
```

### Actual Implementation
- **~500 TypeScript errors** marked as "non-blocking"
- **Multiple WebSocket implementations**: WebSocketService, WebSocketServiceV2, WebRTCVoiceClient
- **Dual cart systems**: UnifiedCartContext AND CartContext still coexist
- **Multiple API clients**: httpClient, unifiedApiClient, secureApi, useApiRequest hook

### Evidence
```typescript
// Found in client/src/modules/order-system/context/CartContext.tsx
const CartContext = createContext<CartContextType | undefined>(undefined);
// Despite CLAUDE.md stating "DO NOT create adapter contexts"

// Multiple WebSocket services
client/src/services/websocket/WebSocketService.ts
client/src/services/websocket/WebSocketServiceV2.ts
client/src/modules/voice/services/WebRTCVoiceClient.ts
```

---

## 2. Naming Convention Battlefield

### The Eternal War: snake_case vs camelCase

Despite documentation claiming "Naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase war ended!)", the battle rages on:

### Database Layer
- Uses `snake_case`: restaurant_id, order_number, menu_item_id
- Supabase RLS policies expect snake_case

### API Layer
- Claims to use `camelCase` but inconsistent
- Transform utilities exist but not universally applied
- Some endpoints return mixed conventions

### Frontend Layer
- TypeScript interfaces use camelCase
- But must handle snake_case from database queries
- Transform layer incomplete, leading to runtime errors

### Impact
- **Runtime type mismatches** causing ErrorBoundary triggers
- **Duplicate type definitions** to handle both conventions
- **Transform utilities** scattered across 4 different locations

---

## 3. Fragmented State Management

### Multiple Paradigms Coexisting

#### Context Providers (Found 3 competing systems)
1. **UnifiedCartContext** - The "blessed" solution per CLAUDE.md
2. **CartContext** - Legacy system still active in order-system module
3. **AuthContext** - Separate authentication state

#### Service Classes (23 class-based implementations)
- WebSocketService (extends EventEmitter)
- OrderService (singleton pattern)
- MenuService (static methods)
- HttpClient (class with constructor injection)

#### Hooks Explosion (22 custom hooks)
- useApiRequest
- useAsyncState
- useOrderHistory
- useKitchenOrdersOptimized
- useKitchenOrdersRealtime (duplicate functionality)

### Architectural Inconsistency
Some modules use hooks + contexts, others use service classes, some use both:
```typescript
// Functional approach
const { cart } = useUnifiedCart();

// Class-based approach
const orderService = new OrderService();

// Mixed approach in same component
const api = useApiRequest();
const wsService = webSocketService; // singleton
```

---

## 4. API Endpoint Chaos

### Inconsistent Route Patterns
```
/api/v1/orders          (RESTful)
/api/v1/ai/chat         (Nested resource)
/api/v1/auth/kiosk      (Action-based)
/api/v1/realtime/session (Mixed paradigm)
/metrics                (No versioning)
/health                 (No namespace)
```

### Multiple HTTP Clients
1. **httpClient.ts** - "Enhanced HTTP Client" with caching
2. **unifiedApiClient.ts** - Class-based with Supabase integration
3. **secureApi.ts** - SecureAPIClient with CSRF
4. **useApiRequest hook** - Wraps fetch with auth
5. **Raw fetch calls** - Still found in 25 files

### Authentication Inconsistency
- Some endpoints use Supabase JWT
- Others use custom demo tokens
- Station login uses different auth flow
- CSRF tokens required sometimes, optional others

---

## 5. Component Architecture Drift

### Error Boundary Proliferation
Found **8 different ErrorBoundary implementations**:
- ErrorBoundary
- GlobalErrorBoundary
- UnifiedErrorBoundary
- PaymentErrorBoundary
- KitchenErrorBoundary
- KioskErrorBoundary
- OrderStatusErrorBoundary
- AppErrorBoundary

Each with slightly different error handling logic and recovery strategies.

### Mixed Component Patterns
- **19 default exports** vs **73 named exports**
- Class components in "errors" directory
- Functional components everywhere else
- Some using React.FC, others using plain functions
- Inconsistent prop typing (interfaces vs inline types)

---

## 6. Configuration Sprawl

### 9 Configuration Files with Overlapping Concerns
```
client/eslint.config.js     - Linting rules
client/vite.config.ts       - Build configuration
client/vitest.config.ts     - Test configuration
client/tailwind.config.js   - Styling configuration
commitlint.config.js        - Commit message rules
eslint.config.js            - Root linting (duplicates client)
playwright.config.ts        - E2E test config
server/vitest.config.ts     - Server test config
postcss.config.js           - CSS processing
```

### Environment Variable Chaos
- Some in .env files
- Some in import.meta.env
- Some in process.env
- Default values scattered across codebase
- No central configuration service

---

## 7. Testing Strategy Fragmentation

### Multiple Test Runners
- Vitest for unit tests
- Playwright for E2E
- Custom test scripts in package.json
- Abandoned Jest configuration artifacts

### Test Coverage Inconsistency
- Some modules heavily tested
- Others completely untested
- Mock strategies vary wildly
- Test data not centralized

---

## 8. Database Schema Evolution

### No Migration System
- No migrations directory found
- Schema changes handled manually
- Supabase dashboard modifications not tracked
- Type definitions drift from actual schema

### Field Naming Inconsistency
```sql
-- Some tables use snake_case
restaurant_id, created_at, updated_at

-- Others use camelCase
orderNumber, tableNumber

-- Mixed within same table
id, restaurant_id, menuItemId
```

---

## 9. WebSocket Implementation Maze

### Three Competing Implementations
1. **WebSocketService** - Original implementation
2. **WebSocketServiceV2** - "Improved" version, not fully adopted
3. **WebRTCVoiceClient** - Voice-specific WebSocket

### Event Pattern Inconsistency
```typescript
// WebSocketService uses EventEmitter
service.on('order:update', handler);

// WebSocketServiceV2 uses different pattern
service.subscribe('orderUpdate', handler);

// WebRTCVoiceClient uses yet another
client.addEventListener('transcript', handler);
```

---

## 10. Abandoned Features & Technical Debt

### Archive Graveyard (67 documents)
- Multiple "FINAL" versions that weren't final
- Superseded architectures still partially implemented
- Planning documents that were never executed
- Completed features marked as "TODO" in code

### Code Comments Revealing Drift
```typescript
// TODO: Remove after migration to new voice system
// HACK: Temporary fix for KDS status handling
// FIXME: This should use UnifiedCartContext
// XXX: Don't change this, it breaks production
```

---

## Drift Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Architecture (v6.0.0)
- Clean separation of concerns
- RESTful API design
- Functional React components

### Phase 2: Rapid Feature Addition (v6.0.1)
- WebSocket integration rushed
- Multiple cart implementations to support different flows
- Class-based components added for error handling

- **Break-even point**: 2 months for full refactor

---

## Realignment Strategy

### Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Week 1-2)
1. **Freeze new patterns** - Document and enforce single approach
2. **Choose winners** - Select one implementation per feature
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Reflect actual state, not aspirational

### Phase 2: Consolidation (Week 3-4)
1. **Unify cart system** - Complete migration to UnifiedCartContext
2. **Single WebSocket service** - Consolidate to WebSocketServiceV2
3. **Standardize API client** - Pick one HTTP client pattern

### Phase 3: Systematic Cleanup (Week 5-8)
1. **Naming convention migration** - Implement automated transform layer
2. **Remove dead code** - Delete archived implementations
3. **Consolidate error boundaries** - Single, configurable solution

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing (Week 9-10)
1. **Architecture decision records** - Document why, not just what
2. **Integration test suite** - Prevent future drift
3. **Developer guidelines** - Enforce patterns via tooling

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Governance (Ongoing)
1. **Drift metrics dashboard** - Track architectural health
2. **Code review checklist** - Prevent pattern proliferation
3. **Quarterly architecture review** - Proactive alignment

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Do This Week)
1. **Pick ONE cart system** - Delete the other
2. **Pick ONE WebSocket service** - Deprecate others
3. **Fix critical type errors** - The "non-blocking" ones that actually block

### Short-term (This Month)
1. **Implement universal transform layer** for snake_case/camelCase
2. **Consolidate configuration** into single source of truth
3. **Create migration system** for database schema

### Long-term (This Quarter)
1. **Refactor to consistent patterns** (functional vs class)
2. **Implement proper dependency injection**
3. **Create architectural fitness functions** for CI/CD

### Cultural Changes
1. **"One way to do things"** principle
2. **Document decisions, not just implementations**
3. **Refactor before adding features** when drift detected

---

## Conclusion

The Restaurant OS has achieved functional success despite significant architectural drift. The system works, but at increasing maintenance cost. The drift patterns reveal a history of rapid development under pressure, with quick fixes accumulating into systemic inconsistencies.

The good news: The core business logic is sound, and the drift is primarily structural rather than fundamental. With disciplined refactoring following the realignment strategy, the codebase can be brought into harmony with its stated architecture within 10 weeks.

The warning: Without intervention, the current trajectory suggests a major architectural crisis within 6 months, where the cost of new features will exceed the cost of a full rewrite.

### Final Assessment
**Current State**: Functional but drifting
**Trajectory**: Unsustainable
**Intervention Required**: YES
**Estimated Recovery Time**: 10 weeks
**ROI on Refactoring**: 3x within 6 months
