# Realtime Voice Processing Issues - Investigation Report

**Date**: August 3, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ùå Realtime endpoint timing out, using fallback to regular endpoint  
**Performance Impact**: 8-second delays before fallback (now disabled)

## üìä Current Situation

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Regular `/api/voice-chat` endpoint works perfectly
- Fallback mechanism works reliably
- Voice processing completes successfully via regular endpoint
- FormData consumption issues fixed
- React key conflicts resolved

### What's Broken ‚ùå
- `/api/voice-chat-realtime` endpoint times out after 8 seconds
- No response from realtime endpoint (not even HTTP errors)
- Complete silence - suggests endpoint doesn't exist or hangs
- BuildPanel promised 50-70% latency reduction not achieved

## üîç Technical Investigation Summary

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Current Implementation (Disabled)
VITE_USE_REALTIME_VOICE=false  // Temporarily disabled

// Attempted Pattern
1. Try realtime endpoint with 8-second timeout
2. If timeout/error ‚Üí immediate fallback to regular endpoint
3. Use fresh FormData for each attempt (fixed consumption bug)
```

### Error Patterns Observed
```
üöÄ Attempting realtime transcript endpoint...
‚è∞ Realtime transcript timeout after 8 seconds  
‚ùå Realtime transcript failed, using regular endpoint: signal is aborted without reason
‚úÖ Regular transcript fallback SUCCESS: /api/voice-chat (mode: regular)
```

### Key Technical Issues Fixed
1. **FormData Consumption Bug** ‚úÖ - Was consuming audio data on first attempt
2. **Race Pattern Complexity** ‚úÖ - Simplified to sequential try-then-fallback
3. **Browser Compatibility** ‚úÖ - Manual AbortController instead of AbortSignal.timeout()
4. **Error Handling** ‚úÖ - Comprehensive logging and graceful fallback

## üéØ Top 5 Guesses - What's Holding Us Back

### 1. **Endpoint Doesn't Exist Yet** (Probability: 85%)
- `/api/voice-chat-realtime` may not be deployed to BuildPanel
- BuildPanel agent might have been referring to planned/internal endpoint
- Regular endpoint working suggests BuildPanel is operational

### 2. **Different Authentication Required** (Probability: 60%)
- Realtime endpoint might need special API keys/headers
- Could require different content-type or accept headers
- Might need authentication that regular endpoint doesn't

### 3. **Infrastructure Not Ready** (Probability: 70%)
- Realtime processing might need specialized infrastructure
- Could be in development/staging but not production
- Might require different backend services not yet deployed

### 4. **Different Request Format** (Probability: 45%)
- Realtime endpoint might expect different data format
- Could need streaming/chunked upload instead of complete FormData
- Might require WebSocket connection instead of HTTP POST

### 5. **Geographic/Network Issues** (Probability: 30%)
- Realtime endpoint might be deployed to different region
- Could have network routing issues
- Might have stricter firewall/proxy rules

## ‚ùì Top 5 Questions for BuildPanel Team

### 1. **Endpoint Availability**
**Q**: Does `/api/voice-chat-realtime` actually exist in production at `https://api.mike.app.buildpanel.ai`?
- If yes, can you provide endpoint documentation?
- If no, what's the correct endpoint URL?
- Is it deployed to same domain as regular endpoint?

### 2. **Request Format & Authentication**
**Q**: What exact request format does the realtime endpoint expect?
- Same FormData structure as regular endpoint?
- Different headers/content-type required?
- Special authentication tokens needed?
- Example working curl command?

### 3. **Response Behavior & Headers**
**Q**: What should we expect from a successful realtime response?
- Same audio/mpeg response as regular endpoint?
- Different response headers (X-Voice-Mode, etc.)?
- Different response timing/streaming behavior?
- How do we detect "realtime mode" was used?

### 4. **Infrastructure & Deployment Status**
**Q**: What's the current deployment status of realtime processing?
- Is it fully deployed and operational?
- Any known issues or maintenance windows?
- Different infrastructure requirements vs regular endpoint?
- Performance metrics/benchmarks available?

### 5. **Integration & Testing**
**Q**: How can we properly test and validate the realtime integration?
- Test endpoint or development environment available?
- Example request/response for debugging?
- Monitoring/logging on your side to see our requests?
- Expected performance improvement metrics?

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Current Code State
```typescript
// Location: client/src/modules/voice/hooks/useVoiceToAudio.ts

// Disabled realtime attempts
const useRealtime = import.meta.env.VITE_USE_REALTIME_VOICE !== 'false'; // Currently false

// Diagnostic function added
const checkRealtimeEndpoint = async (buildPanelUrl: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  // Uses OPTIONS method to check endpoint availability
  // 2-second timeout for quick check
}
```

### Performance Analysis
- **Original**: ~2-3 seconds for voice processing
- **With Realtime Attempts**: ~8+ seconds (timeout + fallback)
- **Current (Disabled)**: Back to ~2-3 seconds
- **Target (If Working)**: ~1-1.5 seconds (50-70% reduction promised)

### Network Behavior
```
Request: POST /api/voice-chat-realtime
Headers: Accept: audio/mpeg
Body: FormData with audio blob
Result: Complete timeout, no HTTP response at all
```

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify endpoint exists** - BuildPanel team confirms URL and availability
2. **Get working example** - Curl command or working request format
3. **Test with authentication** - Try different headers/tokens if needed

### Technical Tests to Run
1. **OPTIONS check** - Verify endpoint responds to preflight
2. **Different methods** - Try GET/HEAD to see if endpoint exists
3. **Network analysis** - Use browser dev tools to see exact request/response
4. **Different environments** - Test against staging/dev if available

### Code Improvements Ready
1. **Smart timeout scaling** - Start with 2s, increase if needed
2. **Better error detection** - Distinguish between timeout vs HTTP errors
3. **Caching endpoint status** - Don't retry failed endpoints repeatedly
4. **Monitoring integration** - Track realtime success/failure rates

## üìã Resolution Checklist

- [ ] Confirm realtime endpoint URL and availability
- [ ] Get working request example from BuildPanel
- [ ] Test endpoint independently (curl/Postman)
- [ ] Update authentication if needed
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for each failure mode
- [ ] Re-enable realtime with proper configuration
- [ ] Measure and validate performance improvements
- [ ] Add monitoring for realtime vs fallback usage
