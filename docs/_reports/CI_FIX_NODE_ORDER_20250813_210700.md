# CI Node Setup Order Fix Report
**Date**: 2025-08-13 21:07:00  
**Branch**: 86BP-phase2-openai  
**Commit**: 584e0a2  
**PR**: #7

## Summary
Successfully fixed the CI workflow failures by ensuring Node.js is installed before any diagnostic step that requires it.

## Root Cause
The workflows were calling `node -v` in the Environment Diagnostics step BEFORE running `actions/setup-node@v4`, causing immediate failures.

## What Changed

### Before (Failing Order)
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  - name: Environment Diagnostics
    run: |
      echo "Node version: $(node -v)"  # ❌ Node not yet installed!
      echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
      ls -la
  
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: 22.x
```

### After (Fixed Order)
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  - name: Environment Diagnostics (pre-setup)
    run: |
      echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
      ls -la
  
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: 22.x
      cache: 'npm'
      cache-dependency-path: client/package-lock.json
  
  - name: Environment Diagnostics (post-setup)
    run: |
      echo "Node version: $(node -v)"  # ✅ Node is now installed!
      echo "npm version: $(npm -v)"
```

## Workflow Run Results

| Workflow | Status | Duration | Node Version | Issues |
|----------|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **frontend-ci** | ✅ SUCCESS | ~30s | v22.18.0 | None - Build completed successfully |
| **playwright-smoke** | ❌ FAILURE | ~1m 30s | v22.18.0 | Tests fail (can't find UI text) but CI runs! |
| **lighthouse-performance** | ❌ FAILURE | ~2m 30s | v22.18.0 | NO_FCP error (page content issue) but CI runs! |

## Proof of Fix

### Frontend-CI Log (Post-Setup Diagnostics)
```
Node version: v22.18.0
npm version: 10.9.3
```
Build completed successfully!

### Playwright-Smoke Log (Post-Setup Diagnostics)
```
Node version: v22.18.0
npm version: 10.9.3
```
CI ran, preview server started, tests executed (failed on app assertions, not CI issues).

### Lighthouse Log (Post-Setup Diagnostics)
```
Node version: v22.18.0
npm version: 10.9.3
```
CI ran, preview server started, Lighthouse executed (failed on FCP metric, not CI issues).

## Remaining Issues (Not CI-Related)

1. **Playwright Tests**: Looking for text "Fresh, Healthy, Local" that doesn't exist in the app
2. **Lighthouse**: Page doesn't render content (NO_FCP) - likely needs investigation of the built app

These are application issues, not CI infrastructure issues. The CI is now deterministic and running properly.

- [Lighthouse Performance Run](https://github.com/mikeyoung304/July25/actions/runs/16949251649)

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Fix Playwright tests**: Update smoke tests to match actual app content
2. **Investigate FCP issue**: Check why the built app isn't rendering for Lighthouse
3. **Consider caching**: Add `actions/cache` for faster dependency installation
4. **Add more logging**: Consider adding build output verification steps

## Conclusion

✅ **PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED**: CI workflows are now deterministic and actually run. Node.js is properly installed before any command that needs it.

The failures in Playwright and Lighthouse are application-level issues (test expectations and rendering), not CI infrastructure problems. The workflows are executing their full intended flow: checkout → setup node → install → build → serve → test.
