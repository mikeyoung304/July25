# BuildPanel Integration Status

## Overview

**STATUS: COMPLETE** - BuildPanel integration has been successfully implemented. This document provides historical context and current architecture details.

## Current Architecture (BuildPanel Integrated)

### Rebuild Backend (Port 3001)
- **Status**: Active - Acts as proxy to BuildPanel
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Role**: Authentication, database operations, WebSocket management

### BuildPanel Service (Port 3003) 
- **Status**: Active - Handles all AI processing
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3003` 
- **Role**: Voice transcription, order parsing, menu AI, chat responses

### Integrated API Routes
- `POST /api/v1/ai/chat` → proxies to BuildPanel `/api/chatbot`
- `POST /api/v1/ai/transcribe` → processes via BuildPanel `/api/voice-chat`
- `POST /api/v1/ai/menu` → syncs menu from BuildPanel `/api/menu`
- WebSocket `/voice-stream` → buffers audio for BuildPanel processing

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# OpenAI Configuration  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
DEFAULT_RESTAURANT_ID=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

# Square Payment Configuration (client-side)
VITE_SQUARE_APP_ID=sandbox-sq0idb-xxxxx
VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=L1234567890
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema (Completed)
- Menu items include proper ID mappings
- `external_id` column added for BuildPanel compatibility
- Restaurant context preserved in all operations

### 2. Menu Synchronization (Active)
```bash
cd server
# Menu sync via BuildPanel integration
npm run upload:menu  # Now syncs via BuildPanel

# Health check includes BuildPanel status
npm run check:integration
```

### 3. Client Integration (Completed)
- API endpoints maintain compatibility (`/api/v1/ai/*`)
- WebSocket connection enhanced for voice streaming
- BuildPanel responses integrated seamlessly
- No breaking changes to frontend code
- Restaurant context flows through all BuildPanel calls

### 4. Current Testing Status

#### Integration Tests (Passing)
- ✅ Menu sync via BuildPanel
- ✅ Voice order processing flow
- ✅ WebSocket voice streaming
- ✅ Chat-based order creation
- ✅ Restaurant context preservation

#### Test Coverage
- BuildPanel service client tests
- AI service coordination tests
- WebSocket voice stream handling
- End-to-end voice ordering flow

### 5. Monitoring & Health Checks
- BuildPanel health check integrated in `/api/v1/ai/health`
- Connection status monitoring in place
- Graceful fallback for BuildPanel disconnection
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Known Issues (Resolved)
- ✅ Auth middleware unified across services
- ✅ Rate limiting applied to BuildPanel calls
- ✅ CORS configured for all required origins
- ✅ WebSocket authentication maintained
- ✅ Menu ID mapping preserved and enhanced
- ✅ Payment integration unaffected

## Success Criteria (Achieved)
1. ✅ Menu sync works via BuildPanel integration
2. ✅ Voice orders process through BuildPanel `/api/voice-chat`
3. ✅ Text orders process through BuildPanel `/api/chatbot`
4. ✅ Real-time updates maintained via WebSocket
5. ✅ All environment variables properly configured
6. ✅ Zero regression in user-facing features
7. ✅ Enhanced AI capabilities via BuildPanel
