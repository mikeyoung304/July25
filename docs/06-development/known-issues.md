# Known Issues & Workarounds

Last Updated: September 10, 2025 | Version: 6.0.4

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Test Suite Completely Broken
**Issue**: Tests timeout after 2+ minutes and have failing assertions  
**Impact**: Cannot measure test coverage or validate code changes  
**Status**: High priority - tests fail with WebSocket auth issues and ErrorBoundary mocking problems  
**Evidence**: 3 failed tests in last run, including WebSocketService and ErrorBoundary tests

### 2. TypeScript Errors (560 count)
**Issue**: 560 TypeScript compilation errors throughout codebase  
**Impact**: App still runs but type safety compromised  
**Status**: Known issue - mostly in test files  
**Workaround**: Use `// @ts-ignore` sparingly, focus on critical paths

### 3. Split Payment UI Missing
**Issue**: Backend split payment functionality exists but no UI implementation  
**Impact**: Feature advertised but not usable by end users  
**Status**: Backend complete, frontend UI needed  
**Priority**: Medium - affects user experience claims

## üü° Minor Issues

### 1. ESLint Warnings
**Issue**: 449 unused variable warnings in the codebase  
**Impact**: None on functionality  
**Workaround**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix where possible  
**Status**: Low priority cleanup task

### 2. Module Type Warning
**Issue**: ESLint config shows module type warning  
**Impact**: Console warning only  
**Fix**: Add `"type": "module"` to client/package.json  
**Status**: Planned for next patch

### 3. WebSocket Idle Timeout
**Issue**: WebSocket disconnects after ~6 minutes of inactivity  
**Impact**: Automatic reconnection within 3 seconds  
**Workaround**: This is expected behavior with exponential backoff  
**Status**: Working as designed

## üîµ Development Issues

### 1. Test Suite Timeouts
**Issue**: Some integration tests may timeout on slower machines  
**Solution**: Increase timeout in vitest.config.ts:
```javascript
testTimeout: 10000 // Increase from 5000
```

### 2. Memory Usage During Build
**Issue**: Build process may use up to 4GB RAM  
**Solution**: Already optimized with NODE_OPTIONS in package.json  
**Note**: Down from 12GB in previous versions

### 3. HMR Cache Issues
**Issue**: Vite HMR may occasionally fail to update  
**Solution**: Clear cache:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

## üì± Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome/Edge 90+ ‚úÖ
- Firefox 88+ ‚úÖ
- Safari 14+ ‚úÖ
- Mobile Safari iOS 14+ ‚úÖ
- Chrome Android 90+ ‚úÖ

### Known Browser Issues
- **Safari**: Voice ordering requires explicit microphone permission
- **Firefox**: WebRTC may require about:config adjustments for local development

## üîß Environment-Specific Issues

### macOS
- **Port conflicts**: Kill existing processes with `npx kill-port 5173 3001`
- **File watching**: May need to increase file descriptor limit

### Windows
- **Path issues**: Use forward slashes in import statements
- **Script execution**: May need to enable script execution policy

### Linux
- **Permissions**: May need to run with elevated permissions for port binding
- **File watching**: Increase inotify watchers if needed

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Large Order Volumes
- **Issue**: KDS may slow with 100+ simultaneous orders
- **Mitigation**: Virtualization planned for next release
- **Workaround**: Archive completed orders regularly

### Memory Leaks
- **Status**: No known memory leaks
- **Monitoring**: Use `npm run test:memory` to verify
- **Prevention**: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## üîÑ WebSocket Specific

### Connection Issues
- **Multiple tabs**: Each tab creates separate WebSocket connection
- **Rate limiting**: Not implemented, but planned
- **Reconnection**: Automatic with exponential backoff

## üìù API Limitations

### Order Creation
- **Authentication**: Demo token required for API calls
- **Rate limits**: None currently implemented
- **Batch operations**: Not supported, single operations only

## üéØ Upcoming Fixes

### Version 6.0.3 (Planned)
- [ ] Clean up ESLint warnings
- [ ] Add module type to package.json
- [ ] Enhance error messages
- [ ] Add rate limiting to APIs

### Version 6.1.0 (Planned)
- [ ] Implement order virtualization for KDS
- [ ] Add batch API operations
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring dashboard
- [ ] WebSocket rate limiting
