# ⚠️ Documentation Status: RED

This repository's documentation is **out of sync** with the code. Until the reset completes:

- **Do NOT** treat archived docs as accurate.
- Trust only the files listed in `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`.
- Voice Customer mode **currently allows** orders to kitchen without payment (SECURITY GAP - client needs to send payment tokens).
- Production deployment guides outside `ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md` are **invalid**.
- Tests are being restored; assume regressions are possible.

Owners: Update `last_verified_date` and `last_verified_commit` on every edit.
