# Production RLS Verdict

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Environment**: PRODUCTION  
**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY SECURE**

## Key Findings

### ✅ All Security Requirements Met

1. **FORCE RLS Enabled**: All 10 critical tables have FORCE RLS enabled
2. **No JWT Claims**: 0 policies using `request.jwt.claims` or custom JWT fields
3. **Membership-Based**: All tenant policies use `is_member_of_restaurant()`
4. **Service Bypass**: Proper service role bypass policies in place

## Comparison with Staging

**PRODUCTION MATCHES STAGING** - The production database already has:
- Same policy structure as staging
- FORCE RLS already enabled on all tables
- No JWT custom claims dependencies
- Membership-based tenant isolation

## Surprising Discovery

The production database appears to have already been updated with the security fixes. This suggests either:
1. The staging changes were already applied to production
2. Production was fixed independently
3. The initial issue assessment may have been based on outdated information

## Migration Status

Given that production already has the correct RLS configuration:
- **Migrations may be idempotent** - Safe to apply but likely no-ops
- **No regression detected** - Production is secure
- **Ready for verification** - Can proceed with auth and smoke tests

## Recommendation

Proceed with Phase 2 (auth testing) to verify the policies work correctly with user tokens.
