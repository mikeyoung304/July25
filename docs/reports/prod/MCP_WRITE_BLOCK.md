# MCP Write Block - API Smoke Tests

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Issue**: Cannot execute API smoke tests via MCP

## Limitation
The smoke test phase requires:
1. Obtaining user authentication tokens from Supabase
2. Making HTTP API calls to the application endpoints
3. Using those tokens in Authorization headers

## MCP Capabilities
- ✅ Can read/write database directly
- ✅ Can verify RLS policies  
- ✅ Can check migrations
- ❌ Cannot make HTTP API calls
- ❌ Cannot authenticate as application users

## Alternative Verification Completed
- Database migrations verified as already applied
- RLS policies confirmed using membership-based checks
- FORCE RLS enabled on all critical tables
- No JWT custom claims found

## Stop Reason
API smoke tests require capabilities outside MCP scope. The database verification shows the system is correctly configured.
