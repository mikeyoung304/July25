# RLS Rewrite Summary

## Phase 1 Complete âœ…

### What Changed
- **Removed**: All policies depending on `request.jwt.claims.restaurant_id` or `auth.jwt() ->> 'restaurant_id'`
- **Added**: Membership-based policies using `public.is_member_of_restaurant()` function
- **Added**: Service role bypass policies for administrative operations

### Migrations Applied
1. `000_is_member_fn.sql` - Created helper function to check user-restaurant membership
2. `010_rls_membership_rewrite.sql` - Replaced 18 JWT-claim policies with 9 membership-based policies
3. `020_service_role_bypass.sql` - Added service role bypass for all tables

### Key Improvement
RLS now depends on actual database relationships (`user_restaurants` table) rather than JWT custom claims that Supabase doesn't provide by default.

### Tables Updated
- tables
- orders
- menu_items
- menu_categories
- restaurants
- order_status_history
- voice_order_logs
- station_tokens
- user_pins
- user_restaurants

### Result
Users authenticated via Supabase Auth can now perform CRUD operations on their restaurant's data without needing custom JWT claims.
