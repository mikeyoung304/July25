# Production Deployment Checklist - Demo Payments Mode

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Version:** v6.0.14
**Deployment Mode:** Demo Payments (Safe Production Test)

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Render Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

Before pushing to main, verify these settings in Render Dashboard:

**Navigate to:** https://dashboard.render.com → Your Service → Environment

#### Required Variables - Check These Now:

```bash
# 1. SQUARE CONFIGURATION (DEMO MODE)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=demo                    # ← MUST be "demo" for safe testing
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox                   # ← Keep as sandbox
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=L1V8KTKZN0DHD           # ← Can be any valid format

# 2. AUTHENTICATION (REQUIRED)
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>       # ← From Supabase Dashboard
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<your-service-key>     # ← From Supabase Dashboard
KIOSK_JWT_SECRET=<your-kiosk-secret>        # ← Random secure string

# 3. DATABASE
SUPABASE_URL=https://xiwfhcikfdoshxwbtjxt.supabase.co
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>

# 4. FRONTEND CORS
FRONTEND_URL=<your-vercel-url>              # ← Your Vercel production URL
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<your-vercel-url>,<other-urls>

# 5. ENVIRONMENT
NODE_ENV=production                          # ← Must be "production"
```

### Critical Settings to Verify

- [ ] **SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN** = `demo` (NOT a real token)
- [ ] **NODE_ENV** = `production`
- [ ] **SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET** is set (server will fail-fast if missing)
- [ ] **FRONTEND_URL** matches your Vercel deployment URL
- [ ] **ALLOWED_ORIGINS** includes your Vercel URL

### What Demo Mode Does

When `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=demo`:
- ✅ All payment flows work end-to-end
- ✅ Orders can be created and completed
- ✅ UI shows successful payments
- ✅ Audit logs are created properly
- ❌ No real credit cards are charged
- ❌ No actual Square API calls are made
- ✅ Safe for production testing

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Final Verification
```bash
# Current branch status (already done)
git status  # ✅ Clean working tree

# Current commits
git log --oneline -5
# Shows Phase 2 completion commits
```

### Step 2: Switch to Main Branch
```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge fix/stability-audit-completion

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment (5-10 minutes)

Watch Render Dashboard:
- https://dashboard.render.com → Your Service → Events

Look for:
```
✅ Build started
✅ Build complete
✅ Deploy started
✅ Deploy live
```

Check logs for:
```
✅ Square credentials validated successfully (demo mode)
✅ Server started on port 3001
✅ Database connected
✅ WebSocket server running
```

### Step 4: Health Checks

After deployment completes:

```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://july25.onrender.com/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}

# Voice service health
curl https://july25.onrender.com/api/v1/ai/voice/handshake

# Expected: 401 (requires auth, but endpoint exists)
```

### Step 5: Frontend Verification

Visit your Vercel frontend:
- https://july25-client.vercel.app (or your URL)

Test flow:
1. ✅ Page loads
2. ✅ Login works
3. ✅ Can create an order
4. ✅ Can proceed to checkout
5. ✅ Payment form shows (Square sandbox form)
6. ✅ Payment completes (demo mode - no real charge)
7. ✅ Order appears in KDS

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Critical Paths to Test

**1. Authentication Flow**
- [ ] Login with credentials works
- [ ] Demo user login works
- [ ] JWT tokens are valid
- [ ] Session persists across page refresh

**2. Order Creation**
- [ ] Can create new order
- [ ] Items add to cart
- [ ] Order total calculates correctly
- [ ] Order saves to database

**3. Payment Flow (Demo Mode)**
- [ ] Checkout button works
- [ ] Payment form loads
- [ ] "Pay" button processes
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Order status updates to "paid"
- [ ] Payment audit log created

**4. Kitchen Display**
- [ ] KDS shows new orders
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Can change order status
- [ ] WebSocket connection stable

**5. Multi-Tenancy**
- [ ] Users only see their restaurant's data
- [ ] Cross-restaurant access returns 404
- [ ] Restaurant context maintained

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

### Option 1: Revert via Render Dashboard
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Rollback
2. Select previous deployment
3. Click "Rollback to this version"

### Option 2: Revert via Git
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or hard reset (only if safe)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main  # ⚠️ Use with caution
```

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Backend health check returns 200
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Order creation works
- [ ] Payment flow completes (demo mode)
- [ ] KDS shows real-time updates
- [ ] No critical errors in Render logs
- [ ] No 500 errors in application

## Known Behaviors (Expected)

**Expected in Demo Mode:**
- Payment succeeds without real card processing
- Square API not called (normal - demo mode)
- Logs show "demo mode active"

**Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore):**
- React 18 warnings in development console
- VITE_ prefix warnings (client-side expected)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment fails to build
**Solution:** Check Render build logs for TypeScript errors

### Issue: Server starts but health check fails
**Solution:** Check SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET is set correctly

### Issue: Payment returns 500
**Solution:** Verify SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=demo in Render

### Issue: CORS errors in browser console
**Solution:** Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes your Vercel URL

### Issue: WebSocket connection fails
**Solution:** Check JWT authentication is working

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

Once production is stable with demo payments:

1. **Monitor for 24-48 hours**
   - Watch error rates
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify stability

2. **Test all user flows**
   - Complete end-to-end testing
   - Verify all features work as expected

3. **Switch to Real Payments** (when ready)
   - Get production Square credentials
   - Update SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN in Render
   - Set SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
   - Test with real test card first
