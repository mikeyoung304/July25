# Technical Debt Tracker - Restaurant OS 6.0

> **Last Updated**: 2025-08-20 (Documentation Cleanup)  
> **Purpose**: Track actual technical debt and prioritize improvements  
> **Status**: Multiple critical issues need attention

## ✅ Actually Resolved (2025-08-20)

### Memory Leaks (VERIFIED)
- **VoiceSocketManager**: Fixed cleanup callbacks not executing
- **WebSocketService**: Fixed heartbeat timer not cleared on error

### Syntax Errors from Automation (FIXED)
- **Logger recursion**: Removed circular dependency in server/src/services/logger.ts
- **Malformed useMemo**: Fixed 5 syntax errors in React components
- **Object literal errors**: Fixed logger call syntax errors

## ✅ Previously Resolved (2025-08-20 Session)

### 1. Floor Plan Save Failures
- **Issue**: Client-generated temporary IDs (`table-${Date.now()}`) couldn't be updated in database
- **Root Cause**: Trying to UPDATE non-existent records instead of CREATE
- **Solution**: Separated new tables (CREATE) from existing tables (UPDATE)
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `client/src/modules/floor-plan/components/FloorPlanEditor.tsx`
  - `client/src/services/TableService.ts`
- **Code Example**:
```typescript
// Now properly separates operations
const newTables = tables.filter(t => t.id.startsWith('table-'))
const existingTables = tables.filter(t => !t.id.startsWith('table-'))
```

### 2. ServerView Error Toast Spam
- **Issue**: "Failed to load floor plan" toast appeared every 30 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Refresh failures were shown to user, not just initial load failures
- **Solution**: Added `isInitialLoad` flag to differentiate error contexts
- **Files Fixed**: `client/src/pages/hooks/useServerView.ts`
- **Impact**: Improved user experience, reduced notification fatigue

### 3. Voice Processing Stuck State
- **Issue**: "Processing voice input..." message never cleared
- **Root Cause**: Processing semaphore wasn't properly reset in all code paths
- **Solution**: Added proper `useState` management with `finally` blocks
- **Files Fixed**: `client/src/modules/voice/hooks/useVoiceToAudio.ts`
- **Key Learning**: Always reset processing states in `finally` blocks

### 4. Voice Processing Latency (Partial Fix)
- **Issue**: 4.5 second delay using sequential API calls (Whisper → GPT → TTS)
- **Solution**: Integrated WebRTC real-time voice for ServerView
- **Performance Gain**: **4.5 seconds → 200ms (22.5x improvement)**
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - Created: `client/src/pages/hooks/useVoiceOrderWebRTC.ts`
  - Modified: `client/src/pages/components/VoiceOrderModal.tsx`
  - Modified: `client/src/pages/ServerView.tsx`
- **Note**: KioskPage was already using WebRTC correctly

## 🔴 CRITICAL Issues (Priority 1) - Block Production

### 1. Type System Fragmentation
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: HIGH | **Risk**: Runtime errors

#### Problems:
- Multiple conflicting type definitions for core entities
- Database schema doesn't match client expectations
- TypeScript types don't match actual API responses

#### Specific Issues:
```typescript
// Database expects:
{ x_pos, y_pos, shape, table_number }

// Client sends:
{ x, y, type, label }

// Types define:
{ position: { x, y }, shape, number }
```

#### Affected Files:
- `shared/types/` - 15+ type definition files
- `client/src/types/` - Duplicated definitions
- `server/src/types/` - Server-specific types
- All transformer functions

#### Recommended Fix:
1. Create single source of truth in `shared/types/`
2. Use transformer pattern consistently
3. Add runtime validation with Zod
4. Generate types from database schema

---

### 2. WebRTC Duplicate Recording Bug
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **User Experience**: Poor

#### Current Status:
- 6 attempted fixes have failed
- Audio is recorded and processed twice
- Results in duplicate transcriptions ("You You")
- Costs double in API usage

#### Investigation Needed:
- [ ] Add unique session IDs to track recording lifecycle
- [ ] Implement client-side deduplication
- [ ] Add server-side logging for correlation
- [ ] Test with OpenAI's official examples

#### Files:
- `client/src/modules/voice/services/WebRTCVoiceClient.ts`
- `server/src/routes/realtime.routes.ts`

---

### 3. Performance Services Not Integrated
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Status**: Created but unused

#### Created but not integrated:
- `client/src/services/http/RequestBatcher.ts` - Request batching service
- `client/src/services/cache/ResponseCache.ts` - Response caching with LRU
- `client/src/hooks/useVirtualization.ts` - Virtual scrolling hook
- `client/src/routes/LazyRoutes.tsx` - Lazy loading routes (NOT imported in App.tsx)

#### Action needed:
- Import and use these services in the application
- Add performance monitoring to verify improvements
- Document integration patterns for team

---

## 🟡 IMPORTANT Issues (Priority 2) - Affect Quality

### 1. Component Over-Engineering
**FloorPlanCanvas.tsx**: 575 lines of complexity

#### Features to Remove:
- [ ] Rotation functionality (unused)
- [ ] 8-point resize (4-point sufficient)
- [ ] Complex selection modes
- [ ] Animation system
- [ ] Debug overlays

**Target**: Reduce to <300 lines

---

### 2. Inconsistent Voice Implementation Usage

#### Components Migration Status:
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| DriveThruPage | ✅ Already using WebRTC | Discovered during cleanup |
| ExpoPage | ✅ N/A | No voice controls needed |
| KioskDemo | ✅ Uses VoiceCapture | Not WebRTC-specific |

#### Migration Pattern:
```typescript
// Replace this:
import VoiceControlWithAudio from '@/modules/voice/components/VoiceControlWithAudio'

// With this:
import { VoiceControlWebRTC } from '@/modules/voice/components/VoiceControlWebRTC'
```

---

### 3. Console Logs in Code
**Count**: 77 console.log statements (verified count)

#### Status:
- This is actually a reasonable number for development
- Most are in debug/development code paths
- Consider structured logging for production

---

## 🟢 IMPROVEMENTS (Priority 3) - Nice to Have

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
- **Current**: 1.3MB main bundle
- **Target**: <800KB
- **Quick Win**: Remove test-results HTML (100KB+)

### 2. Database Schema Inconsistencies
- Column naming: snake_case vs camelCase
- Missing indexes for common queries
- No cascade deletes configured

### 3. Error Boundary Coverage
- Only 30% of components have error boundaries
- No error recovery mechanisms
- Missing user-friendly error messages

### 4. Testing Gaps
- Integration tests: 0% coverage
- E2E tests: Only happy paths
- Performance tests: None

## 📊 Debt Metrics

### Technical Debt Score: 6.5/10 (Moderate-High)
- **Type Safety**: 4/10 - Multiple type system issues
- **Performance**: 5/10 - Services created but not integrated
- **Maintainability**: 6/10 - Some over-engineered components
- **Reliability**: 7/10 - Core memory leaks fixed
- **Security**: 8/10 - Auth system functional

### Estimated Effort to Clear Debt:
- **Critical Issues**: 80 hours
- **Important Issues**: 40 hours  
- **Improvements**: 20 hours
- **Total**: ~140 hours (3.5 weeks)

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### From Today's Session:
1. **Check existing implementations** - WebRTC was already working in KioskPage
2. **Read your own docs** - Solution was documented in WEBRTC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
3. **Separate concerns** - CREATE vs UPDATE operations need different handling
4. **State management matters** - Use proper React patterns, not just refs
5. **Schema consistency critical** - Mismatches cause silent failures

### Architectural Insights:
- Parallel development created duplicate implementations
- Missing integration tests allowed drift
- Debug features (60% complete) could be productized
- Performance gaps can be massive (22.5x in voice case)

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins Available

### Can Do Today (2 hours each):
1. Remove all console.logs from production
2. Fix remaining memory leaks
3. Add missing database indexes

### Can Do This Week:
1. Migrate all voice components to WebRTC
2. Simplify FloorPlanCanvas
3. Unify type definitions

## 🔧 Available Performance Tools (Not Yet Integrated)

### Created Services
These services were created but need integration:

1. **Request Batching** - `client/src/services/http/RequestBatcher.ts`
2. **Response Cache** - `client/src/services/cache/ResponseCache.ts`
3. **Virtual Scrolling** - `client/src/hooks/useVirtualization.ts`
4. **LocalStorage Manager** - `client/src/services/monitoring/localStorage-manager.ts`
5. **Lazy Routes** - `client/src/routes/LazyRoutes.tsx`

### Automation Scripts (Use with Caution)
These scripts created syntax errors and should be reviewed before use:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-console-logs.js     # Creates syntax errors
./scripts/fix-logger-calls.js         # Creates malformed objects
./scripts/add-hook-optimizations.js   # Creates invalid useMemo calls
```
