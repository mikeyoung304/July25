# Restaurant OS Authentication Guide

**IMPORTANT**: This document has been superseded by the master authentication documentation.

➡️ **Please refer to [AUTHENTICATION_MASTER.md](./AUTHENTICATION_MASTER.md) for the latest authentication documentation.**

## Version History

- **v6.0.4** (Jan 30, 2025): Role hierarchy system implemented - see [AUTHENTICATION_MASTER.md](./AUTHENTICATION_MASTER.md)
- **v6.0.3** (Sep 6, 2025): Previous version (archived)

## Why This Redirect?

As of January 30, 2025, we've consolidated all authentication documentation into a single master document to:
- Provide a single source of truth
- Include the new role hierarchy system
- Document all security enhancements
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

*This file is maintained for backward compatibility and will redirect to the master authentication documentation.*
