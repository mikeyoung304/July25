## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

The application aims to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards with the following implementations:

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

#### Global Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + K` - Navigate to Kitchen Display

- `Ctrl/Cmd + H` - Navigate to Order History
- `/` - Focus search input
- `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts help
- `Escape` - Close modals/dialogs

#### Order Card Navigation

- `Arrow Keys` - Navigate between order cards (in grid/list view)
- `Home` - Jump to first order
- `End` - Jump to last order
- `Enter/Space` - Activate buttons

#### Order Actions Shortcuts
- `Alt + S` - Start preparing order (when focused on new order)
- `Alt + R` - Mark order as ready (when focused on preparing order)

### 2. Screen Reader Support

- Descriptive error messages
- Suggestions for resolution
- Error messages associated with form fields

#### Error Prevention
- Input validation with clear requirements
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Undo capabilities where appropriate

## Implementation Details

### Custom Hooks

#### `useKeyboardNavigation`
Manages keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns.

```typescript
const shortcuts = useKeyboardNavigation({
  onEnter: () => handleAction(),
  onEscape: () => handleClose(),
  enabled: true
})
```

#### `useFocusTrap`
Traps focus within a container (useful for modals).

```typescript
useFocusTrap({
  containerRef: modalRef,
  enabled: isOpen,
  returnFocusOnDeactivate: true
})
```

#### `useAriaLive`
Announces dynamic content changes to screen readers.

```typescript
const announce = useAriaLive()
announce({
  message: 'Order status updated',
  priority: 'polite'
})
```

#### `useFocusManagement`
Manages focus between multiple items (like order cards).

```typescript
const focusManager = useFocusManagement({
  containerRef: ordersRef,
  itemSelector: '[data-order-card]',
  orientation: 'grid'
})
```

### Accessible Components

#### `AccessibleCard`
Card component with proper ARIA attributes.

```tsx
<AccessibleCard
  ariaLabel="Order #001"
  role="article"
  focusable={true}
>
  {/* Card content */}
</AccessibleCard>
```

#### `AccessibleButton`
Button component with loading states and ARIA support.

```tsx
<AccessibleButton
  ariaLabel="Start preparing order"
  ariaKeyShortcuts="Alt+S"
  loading={isLoading}
  loadingText="Processing..."
>
  Start Preparing
</AccessibleButton>
```

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate the entire application using only the keyboard
2. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
3. Check color contrast with browser tools
4. Test at 200% zoom level
5. Test with Windows High Contrast mode

### Automated Testing
- ESLint with jsx-a11y plugin
- Jest tests for ARIA attributes
- Axe-core for accessibility audits

### Browser Testing
- Chrome with Lighthouse
- Firefox with Accessibility Inspector
- Safari with VoiceOver
- Edge with Narrator

## Known Limitations

1. Complex data tables may require additional navigation patterns
2. Real-time updates may be overwhelming for some screen reader users
3. Sound notifications require user permission

## Future Enhancements

1. Alternative color schemes for color-blind users
2. Customizable keyboard shortcuts
3. Voice control integration
4. Haptic feedback for mobile devices
5. Simplified UI mode for cognitive accessibility
