# Archive Summary - August 20, 2025

## Reason for Archival

These documents were archived during the documentation cleanup on August 20, 2025. They contained:
- False or unverified performance claims
- Outdated information from automated refactoring attempts
- Duplicate content that exists in better form elsewhere
- Debug analyses that are no longer relevant

## Archived Files

### False/Unverified Claims
- `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT_FINAL.md` - Claimed 83% bundle reduction (unverified)
- `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT_PHASE1.md` - Claimed 791 console.logs removed (only 77 exist)
- `optimization-report.md` - Various unverified performance metrics
- `TECH_DEBT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Overstated accomplishments

### Outdated Debug/Analysis
- `KITCHEN-DISPLAY-DEBUG-ANALYSIS.md` - Old KDS debugging (issues now fixed)
- `realtimewoes.md` - Old WebRTC issues documentation
- `SECURITY_CRITICAL_ACTIONS.md` - Outdated security concerns

### Duplicate Documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Duplicate of docs/deployment.md
- `DEVELOPER_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Duplicate of docs/QUICKSTART.md
- `CRITICAL_SETUP.md` - Redundant setup instructions

### Tool-Specific
- `CLAUDE_CODE_FEATURES_GUIDE.md` - Claude-specific features (not project docs)

## What Actually Happened

The "overnight optimization" session created:
1. Several useful performance services (RequestBatcher, ResponseCache, etc.)
2. Multiple syntax errors from automated refactoring
3. Exaggerated documentation about improvements

The actual improvements were:
- Fixed 2 memory leaks (VoiceSocketManager, WebSocketService)
- Created performance services (not yet integrated)
- Fixed floor plan save issues
- Fixed voice processing stuck state

## Lessons Learned

1. Always verify performance claims with actual measurements
2. Test automated refactoring scripts thoroughly before applying
3. Document what was actually done, not what was intended
4. Keep documentation close to the code and update it together
