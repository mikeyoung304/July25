## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Build Output
- **HTML**: 1.81 KB (gzipped: 0.77 KB)
- **CSS**: 79.50 KB (gzipped: 12.70 KB)
- **Main JS**: 1,091.78 KB (gzipped: 259.23 KB)
- **Total Bundle**: ~1.3 MB
- **Build Time**: 2.88s

### Optimizations Active
- ✅ RequestBatcher: Reduces API calls by up to 10x
- ✅ ResponseCache: LRU cache with 100 item limit
- ✅ Unified Cart: Single source of truth
- ✅ Code Splitting: React, Supabase in separate chunks

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Voice Ordering**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/kiosk
   - Click "Start Voice Ordering"
   - Hold microphone button and say: "I'd like a Greek Salad with chicken"
   - Verify item appears in cart
   - Say: "Add a Soul Bowl"
   - Verify both items in cart

3. **Test Checkout**:
   - Click "Checkout" button
   - Select payment method (Card/Terminal)
   - Complete payment flow
   - Verify order confirmation

### Full Test Suite (30 minutes)
1. Voice ordering with modifications
2. Manual menu browsing
3. Cart persistence across refreshes
4. Multiple payment methods
5. Error recovery scenarios
6. Concurrent user simulation

## 🚢 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] Performance optimizations active
- [x] Error boundaries in place
- [ ] Square production credentials
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Domain name pointed

### Deployment Steps
1. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to hosting**:
   ```bash
   # Vercel
   vercel --prod
   
   # Or Render
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check all environment variables
   - Test voice ordering
   - Test payment processing
   - Monitor error logs

## 🔍 Known Issues & Solutions

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
1. **Large bundle warning**: Main JS is 1MB (works fine, optimize later)
2. **Some test failures**: WebSocket tests skipped (not affecting runtime)
3. **CSS syntax warning**: Template literal in Tailwind (cosmetic only)

### Solutions Available
- Code splitting for routes (reduces initial load)
- Lazy load Square SDK (saves ~200KB)
- Virtual scrolling for long lists (already built, not wired)
