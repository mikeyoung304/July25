## ðŸš§ Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Voice System Stability**
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Fallback: Manual order entry mode
   
2. **Payment Processing**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive error handling
   - Fallback: Offline payment queue
   
3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Mitigation: WebSocket reconnection logic
   - Fallback: Polling mechanism

### Contingency Plans
- **If timeline slips:** Focus on P0/P1 issues only
- **If resources limited:** Prioritize security over features
- **If testing reveals major issues:** Delay launch by 1 week

## ðŸ‘¥ Resource Allocation

### Team Structure (Recommended)
- **Security Lead:** P0 security issues (Days 1-2)
- **Backend Engineer:** API optimization, database (Days 3-5)
- **Frontend Engineer:** Component refactoring, testing (Days 3-5)
- **DevOps Engineer:** CI/CD, monitoring (Week 2)
- **QA Engineer:** Testing, load testing (Ongoing)

### Daily Standup Topics
1. P0/P1 issue status
2. Blockers and dependencies
3. Test coverage progress
4. Performance metrics
5. Security scan results
