# Documentation Archive - January 26, 2025

## Purpose

This archive contains documentation that has been superseded, is outdated, or was part of planning phases that have been completed. These files are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development.

## Archive Structure

### `/outdated/`
Documentation that contains information that is no longer accurate or relevant:
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` - Snapshot from August 2025, metrics outdated
- `PHASE2_PROGRESS.md` - Completed phase tracking
- `OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md` - Old optimization metrics
- `MEMORY_LEAK_FIXES_20250820.md` - Issues already resolved
- `PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS_20250821.md` - Completed improvements
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY_2025-08-20.md` - Old cleanup report
- `OPERATIONAL_INSIGHTS.md` - Outdated operational data
- `EXPO_STATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Old feature analysis
- `LAUNCH_READY_FINAL.md` - Pre-launch checklist (completed)
- `PHASE-8-INTEGRATION-REPORT.md` - Completed integration phase

### `/planning/`
Planning documents for features that have been implemented:
- `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` - Debt tracking (mostly resolved)
- `OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md` - Completed optimization plan
- `REALTIME_RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` - Risk analysis (mitigated)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Completed implementation plan
- `MVP.md` - MVP planning (achieved)

### `/superseded/`
Documentation replaced by newer, consolidated versions:
- `CLAUDE-REFERENCE.md` - Replaced by CLAUDE.md
- `client/README_ORDERING.md` - Consolidated into voice-ordering.md

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Outdated Information**: Many documents referenced old architecture (port 3002, separate AI Gateway) that no longer exists
2. **Completed Phases**: Progress tracking documents for phases that are complete
3. **Consolidated Content**: Information that has been merged into comprehensive guides
4. **Historical Planning**: Planning documents for features now implemented
5. **Incorrect Patterns**: Documentation showing patterns we explicitly don't follow

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date information, refer to:
- `/docs/README.md` - Documentation hub
- `/docs/01-getting-started/` - Setup and installation
- `/docs/02-architecture/` - Current architecture
- `/docs/03-features/` - Feature documentation
- `/docs/04-api/` - API reference
- `/docs/05-operations/` - Deployment and operations
- `/docs/06-development/` - Development guide

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT use these archived docs for current development**
- **Security violations** in some old docs (client-side API keys)
- **Architecture conflicts** with current unified backend approach
- **Version mismatches** between claimed and actual versions

## Accessing Archive

If you need to reference archived documentation:
1. Understand it may be incorrect or outdated
2. Cross-reference with current documentation
3. Ask team before implementing any patterns from archive
4. Consider why it was archived before using
