# üîí Security Audit Report - Restaurant OS v6.0

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Auditor**: Senior Apple Security Engineer  
**Severity Levels**: üî¥ Critical | üü† High | üü° Medium | üîµ Low

---

## Executive Summary

The Restaurant OS codebase has several critical security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The most severe issues include exposed production credentials, weak authentication mechanisms, and disabled security controls. While the application implements some security best practices (Supabase ORM for SQL injection prevention, input validation with Joi), critical gaps remain that could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.

---

## üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Exposed Production Secrets in .env File**
**Location**: `/.env`  
**Risk**: Complete system compromise

#### Details:
- OpenAI API key exposed (line 11): `sk-proj-WCGmZJlvkAY4cVhjlAA9ya_77PsTSovmmXo_...`
- Supabase service key with admin privileges (line 6)
- Square payment token (line 29): `EAAAl0B9Dc8dvpuk5G3gpAHxHiShdBDHB3EvjPwh8nr-7VUB5IwVLC-2DJ899X_0`
- Database password in connection string (line 3)
- Weak JWT secret (line 15): `demo-secret-key-for-local-development-only`

#### Impact:
- Attackers can access production database with full admin privileges
- OpenAI API abuse leading to significant financial loss
- Payment system compromise
- Complete authentication bypass

#### Recommendations:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Rotate all exposed keys and tokens
2. Move secrets to secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
3. Never commit `.env` files to version control
4. Use environment-specific configuration
5. Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline

---

### 2. **CSRF Protection Disabled**
**Location**: `/client/src/services/secureApi.ts` (lines 52-56)  
**Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks

#### Details:
```typescript
// Only add CSRF if backend supports it (currently disabled)
// const csrfHeaders = CSRFTokenManager.getHeader()
```

#### Impact:
- Malicious websites can perform actions on behalf of authenticated users
- Unauthorized transactions and data modifications

#### Recommendations:
1. Enable CSRF protection immediately
2. Implement double-submit cookie pattern
3. Use SameSite cookie attribute
4. Add origin validation

---

## üü† High Severity Issues

### 3. **Weak Authentication Implementation**
**Location**: `/server/src/middleware/auth.ts`  
**Risk**: Authentication bypass, token manipulation

#### Issues Found:
- Test token bypass in development (lines 40-52)
- JWT algorithm not specified - vulnerable to algorithm confusion attacks
- Fallback to public anon key if JWT secret not set (lines 65-66)
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts

#### Recommendations:
1. Remove test token logic entirely
2. Specify JWT algorithm explicitly: `jwt.verify(token, secret, { algorithms: ['HS256'] })`
3. Fail closed if JWT secret is missing
4. Implement exponential backoff for failed auth attempts

---

### 4. **Payment Processing Security Issues**
**Location**: `/server/src/routes/payments.routes.ts`  
**Risk**: Payment manipulation, fraud

#### Issues Found:
- Client can provide their own idempotency key (line 43)
- Amount manipulation risk - client provides amount (line 29)
- Demo mode allows fake payments (line 85)
- No rate limiting on payment attempts

#### Recommendations:
1. Generate idempotency keys server-side only
2. Calculate amounts server-side based on order items
3. Remove demo payment bypass in production builds
4. Add strict rate limiting on payment endpoints

---

### 5. **Vulnerable Dependencies**
**Risk**: Known security vulnerabilities

#### Critical Vulnerabilities:
```
- body-parser: HIGH severity
- express: HIGH severity  
- path-to-regexp: HIGH severity
- esbuild: MODERATE severity
```

#### Recommendations:
1. Update Express to 4.21.2
2. Run `npm audit fix` regularly
3. Implement automated dependency scanning
4. Use Dependabot or similar tools

---

## üü° Medium Severity Issues

### 6. **Rate Limiting Bypassed in Development**
**Location**: `/server/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`  
**Risk**: Resource exhaustion, API abuse

#### Details:
- All rate limits disabled with `skip: (req: Request) => isDevelopment`
- Could be accidentally enabled in production

#### Recommendations:
1. Use configuration flags instead of NODE_ENV
2. Implement rate limiting even in development (with higher limits)
3. Add monitoring for rate limit violations

---

### 7. **Information Disclosure**
**Location**: `/server/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` (line 38)  
**Risk**: Sensitive information leakage

#### Details:
- Stack traces logged which could expose file paths and logic
- Error details exposed in non-production environments

#### Recommendations:
1. Sanitize error messages in production
2. Log stack traces to secure logging service only
3. Implement structured error responses

---

### 8. **WebSocket Security Gaps**
**Location**: `/server/src/utils/websocket.ts`  
**Risk**: Unauthorized real-time data access

#### Issues:
- No rate limiting on WebSocket messages
- Missing input validation on WebSocket payloads
- No connection limits per user

#### Recommendations:
1. Implement WebSocket rate limiting
2. Validate all incoming WebSocket messages
3. Add connection pooling limits

---

## üîµ Low Severity Issues

### 9. **Missing Security Headers**
**Risk**: Various client-side attacks

#### Missing Headers:
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS enforcement)
- Referrer-Policy

#### Recommendations:
1. Configure Helmet.js properly for all environments
2. Add custom security headers
3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

---

### 10. **Session Management Issues**
**Risk**: Session hijacking

#### Issues:
- No session invalidation on logout
- Missing session rotation after authentication
- No absolute session timeout

#### Recommendations:
1. Implement proper session lifecycle
2. Add session fingerprinting
3. Use secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies

---

## ‚úÖ Positive Security Findings

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Supabase ORM provides parameterized queries
2. **Input Validation**: Joi validation middleware properly implemented
3. **XSS Protection**: No dangerous DOM manipulation found (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
4. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Proper restaurant_id filtering in queries
5. **CORS Configuration**: Whitelist approach for allowed origins
6. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Proper TLS configuration in production
