# React Production Crash Hotfix Report
Date: 2025-09-24
Issue: React.forwardRef undefined in production preview

## Phase 0: Diagnosis

### Current React Dependencies
```
npm ls react react-dom --workspaces
All packages using React 19.1.0 and react-dom 19.1.0 (consistent)
```

### Package.json Analysis
- Client dependencies: react@19.1.0, react-dom@19.1.0
- No overrides currently defined
- Using @vitejs/plugin-react for build

### Build Config Analysis
- **Vite config (client/vite.config.ts)**:
  - Using @vitejs/plugin-react ✅
  - optimizeDeps includes react and react-dom ✅
  - No external/externals config found ✅
  - Manual chunks split React libs (lines 52-67)
  - No preact/compat aliasing ✅

### JSX Runtime
- client/tsconfig.app.json has `"jsx": "react-jsx"` ✅

### Likely Cause
The issue appears to be related to:
1. React 19.1.0 (very recent version, potentially unstable)
2. Manual chunking strategy might be splitting React internals incorrectly
3. No explicit version pinning via overrides

## Phase 1: Enforce Single React Version
- Added overrides to root package.json:
  ```json
  "overrides": {
    "react": "18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "18.3.1"
  }
  ```
- Updated client/package.json to use React 18.3.1
- Reinstalled dependencies
- Verified all packages now use React 18.3.1

## Phase 2: Vite Config Hardening
- Modified manual chunks to keep React core together (react-bundle)
- Added react/jsx-runtime and react/jsx-dev-runtime to optimizeDeps
- No externalization or preact aliasing found (already clean)

## Phase 3: JSX Runtime
- Confirmed client/tsconfig.app.json has "jsx": "react-jsx" ✅

## Phase 4: Build & Deploy
- Build successful with new configuration
- Preview deployed: https://client-bk1iulkrh-mikeyoung304-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

## Summary of Changes
1. **Downgraded React from 19.1.0 to 18.3.1** (stable LTS version)
2. **Added npm overrides** to enforce single version across all packages
3. **Fixed Vite chunking** to keep React internals together
4. **Added JSX runtimes** to optimizeDeps for proper bundling
