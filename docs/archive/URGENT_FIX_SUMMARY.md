# URGENT: Payment System Completely Broken

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** üö® PRODUCTION DOWN - Payment Processing Blocked
**Priority:** P0 - Deploy immediately

---

## The Problem

**Missing Table:** `payment_audit_logs` does not exist in production database

**Impact:** ALL payment attempts fail with 500 error

**Root Cause:** Migration was incorrectly archived on Oct 20 as "optional feature"

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
// server/src/services/payment.service.ts:221
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('payment_audit_logs')  // ‚ö†Ô∏è TABLE DOESN'T EXIST
  .insert(auditLog);

if (error) {
  // FAIL-FAST: Per ADR-009, audit log failures MUST block payment
  throw new Error('Payment processing unavailable - audit system failure');
}
```

---

## The Fix (5 minutes)

### 1. Deploy Migration

```bash
cd /Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0

# Push the migration to production
supabase db push --linked

# Migration file: supabase/migrations/20251023000000_add_payment_audit_logs.sql
```

### 2. Verify Table Exists

```bash
# Check table created (requires psql access)
psql <connection-string> -c "\d payment_audit_logs"

# Or via Supabase dashboard:
# Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí Look for "payment_audit_logs"
```

### 3. Test Payment Flow

```bash
# On production site (july25.vercel.app):
# 1. Create test order
# 2. Submit payment
# 3. Should complete successfully (no 500 error)

# Check audit log populated:
# Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor:
# SELECT * FROM payment_audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## What Went Wrong

1. **Feb 1, 2025:** Migration created for payment_audit_logs
2. **July-Oct 2025:** Code developed using this table (payment.service.ts)
3. **Oct 20, 2025:** Migration archived as "optional feature" (wrong!)
4. **Oct 23, 2025:** Production payment processing fails

**Archival Note Was Wrong:**
```
"This feature is not currently used in production"
```

**Reality:**
```typescript
// FAIL-FAST: Per ADR-009 and SECURITY.md, audit log failures MUST block payment
// This is a PCI DSS compliance requirement - payment audit logs are mandatory
```

## Files to Review

1. **Migration:** `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0/supabase/migrations/20251023000000_add_payment_audit_logs.sql`
2. **Audit Report:** `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0/DATABASE_SCHEMA_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
3. **Code Using Table:** `/Users/mikeyoung/CODING/rebuild-6.0/server/src/services/payment.service.ts`

## Other Schema Items (All OK)

‚úÖ **restaurants.tax_rate** - Present (migration 20251019180000)
‚úÖ **orders.version** - Present (migration 20251019183600)  
‚úÖ **order_status_history.created_at** - Present (migration 20251021231910)
‚úÖ **All other tables** - Present and working

**Only Issue:** payment_audit_logs missing

---

## Next Steps After Fix

1. Update `.archive/README.md` to correct payment_audit_logs status
2. Add automated schema validation to deployment pipeline
3. Create schema smoke tests for critical tables
4. Document all table dependencies before archiving migrations

**Deploy this now. Payment processing is completely blocked.**
