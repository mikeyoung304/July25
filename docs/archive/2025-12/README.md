# Archive: December 2025

Archived on 2025-12-24 during enterprise readiness audit prep.

## Why Archived

These files contained outdated "CRITICAL" and "URGENT" flags from October-November 2025 that no longer reflect current codebase state. Keeping them in active docs caused confusion.

## Contents

| Directory | Files | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| audit/ | 19 | Oct 31 overnight audit, codebase snapshots, P0 roadmaps |
| reports/ | 22 | Phase completion reports, epic summaries, test reports |
| investigations/ | 4 | Dated investigation files (Oct-Nov) |
| root-docs/ | 18 | Dated assessments, consolidation reports, post-mortems |

## Key Resolved Issues (from archived audit)

These were marked CRITICAL in Oct 2025, now resolved:
- ✅ .env secrets exposure → properly gitignored
- ✅ API key fragments in docs → redacted
- ✅ Broken Claude commands → reorganized
- ✅ Hardcoded paths → fixed

## Still Relevant

Post-mortems contain valuable lessons but are historical records.
ADRs in `docs/explanation/architecture-decisions/` remain current.
