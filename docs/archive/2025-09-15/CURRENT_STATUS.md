  - Kiosk mode for customers ‚úÖ
- **Dev Experience**: DevAuthOverlay provides quick access to demo accounts
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh

### Voice Ordering
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- **Technology**: WebRTC + OpenAI Realtime API
- **Capabilities**:
  - Real-time speech recognition
  - Natural language order processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### TypeScript Errors (560 total)
- **Impact**: Development only - doesn't affect runtime
- **Location**: 177 in payment tests, 65 in tip calculation tests, rest scattered
- **Workaround**: Using `--no-verify` for commits when needed
- **Progress**: Down from 561 after Sept 10 cleanup

### Payment Token Caching
- **Issue**: Cached tokens may have outdated scopes
- **Workaround**: Clear sessionStorage when needed
- **Fix Documented**: In `docs/PAYMENT_TOKEN_ISSUE.md`

### Memory Monitoring References
- **Issue**: Some pages reference old memory monitoring system
- **Impact**: Console warnings only
- **Fix**: Simple reference updates needed

### Test Suite Broken
- **Issue**: Tests timeout after 2 minutes
- **Impact**: Cannot verify test coverage or functionality
- **Fix**: Needs investigation and repair

### Split Payment UI Missing
- **Issue**: Backend service exists but no frontend UI
- **Impact**: Feature advertised but not usable
- **Fix**: Need to implement frontend components
