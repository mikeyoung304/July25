# Archive: Pre-Backend Documentation

**Archive Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Context**: Full-stack architecture evolution

## üìö Archived Files

This directory contains documentation from when the project was frontend-only, before we gained control of the backend development.

### Archived Files:
- `README.md.archived` - Original README with frontend-only restrictions
- `CLAUDE.md.archived` - Original project instructions for Claude Code
- `MaconAI_Dev_Protocol.md.archived` - AI Gateway protocol with Luis backend references

## üìã Historical Context

### Previous Architecture (Frontend-Only)
- **Period**: Project inception through July 2025
- **Backend**: Planned to be developed by Luis (external team member)
- **Frontend Role**: Limited to UI and service layer connecting to future API
- **Integration**: Mock data and service adapters awaiting real backend

### Key Restrictions (Now Removed):
- "Frontend NEVER accesses database directly"
- "Frontend services are ONLY integration point with backend"
- References to "Luis's backend" throughout documentation
- Mock-only development patterns

## üîÑ Evolution Trigger

**Decision Point**: Luis gave approval for us to develop the backend ourselves, eliminating the need for external backend dependency and frontend-only restrictions.

### What Changed:
1. **Full-Stack Control**: We now develop both frontend and backend
2. **Direct Database Access**: Backend services can directly integrate with Supabase
3. **Complete API Control**: We design and implement our own Express.js API
4. **Unified Development**: Single team manages entire technology stack

## üéØ Migration Outcomes

The archived documentation has been replaced with:
- **BACKEND_GUIDE.md**: Complete backend development instructions
- **FULLSTACK_ARCHITECTURE.md**: System-wide architectural overview
- **Updated README.md**: Full-stack development workflows
- **Consolidated Voice Docs**: Unified voice ordering implementation guide

## üîç Reference Value

These archived files remain valuable for:
- Understanding the project's architectural evolution
- Reviewing original frontend-only design decisions
- Learning from the service adapter pattern implementation
- Historical context for future architectural decisions
