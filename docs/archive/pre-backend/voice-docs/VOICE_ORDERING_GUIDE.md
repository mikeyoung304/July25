# Voice Ordering Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

We've successfully built a customer-facing voice ordering system with two interfaces:
1. **Kiosk Interface** (`/kiosk`) - For in-store touchscreen ordering
2. **Drive-Thru Interface** (`/drive-thru`) - For vehicle ordering with larger UI

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev:ai
```

This single command starts both the frontend and AI Gateway together. Then navigate to:
- http://localhost:5173/kiosk
- http://localhost:5173/drive-thru

For detailed instructions, see `QUICK_START_VOICE_ORDERING.md`

## 📁 Implementation Details

### New Components Created

1. **VoiceOrderContext** (`src/modules/orders/contexts/VoiceOrderContext.tsx`)
   - Manages the real-time order state
   - Provides methods to add/remove/update items
   - Calculates totals and handles modifications

2. **VoiceControl** (`src/modules/voice/components/VoiceControl.tsx`)
   - Push-to-talk button with "HOLD ME" text
   - WebSocket connection for streaming audio
   - Visual feedback (red when recording, pulsing when processing)

3. **OrderParser** (`src/modules/orders/services/OrderParser.ts`)
   - Parses AI responses to extract menu items
   - Handles quantities, modifications, and actions
   - Builds menu database with aliases

4. **KioskPage** (`src/pages/KioskPage.tsx`)
   - Split-screen layout (conversation + order)
   - Real-time order updates
   - Scrollable conversation history

5. **DriveThruPage** (`src/pages/DriveThruPage.tsx`)
   - Optimized for vehicle viewing
   - Larger text and buttons
   - Auto-scrolling conversation
   - Dark theme for better visibility

### AI Gateway Enhancements

**File**: `ai-gateway-websocket.js`
- WebSocket server for streaming audio
- Menu context integration
- Mock transcription (ready for Whisper API)
- Chat endpoint with order-taking personality

## 🎨 Features Implemented

### Voice Interaction
- ✅ Push-to-talk functionality
- ✅ WebSocket streaming for real-time transcription
- ✅ Visual feedback during recording/processing
- ✅ Initial greeting on first press

### Order Management
- ✅ Real-time order building as user speaks
- ✅ Item modifications (no pickles, extra cheese, etc.)
- ✅ Quantity updates
- ✅ Running total display
- ✅ Remove items functionality

### UI/UX
- ✅ Split-screen layout for kiosk
- ✅ Large-text interface for drive-thru
- ✅ Smooth animations for order updates
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Brand colors and styling

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# AI Gateway
PORT=3002
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Mock Menu Data
The system includes mock menu items in `useMenuItems.ts`:
- Burgers (Classic, Bacon, Cheese, Veggie)
- Sides (Fries, Onion Rings, Salad)
- Drinks (Sodas, Juice, Coffee)
- Desserts (Shakes, Apple Pie)

## 💰 Cost Optimization

The implementation includes several cost-saving features:
1. **Streaming only on button release** - Reduces unnecessary API calls
2. **Audio buffering** - Processes chunks efficiently
3. **Mock mode** - Can run without OpenAI for testing
4. **Partial transcripts** - Shows progress without final API call

## 🧪 Testing the System

1. **Basic Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/kiosk`
   - Hold the "HOLD ME" button
   - Say "I'd like a bacon burger with no pickles"
   - Release button
   - Watch order appear in real-time

2. **Modifications**:
   - "Actually, make that two burgers"
   - "Add a large coke"
   - "No onions on one of them"

3. **Drive-Thru**:
   - Navigate to `/drive-thru`
   - Note larger UI elements
   - Test auto-scrolling conversation

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Connect Real Whisper API**:
   - Replace mock transcription in WebSocket handler
   - Add audio format conversion if needed

2. **Enhance Order Parser**:
   - Add more menu item variations
   - Improve modification detection
   - Handle complex orders better

3. **Add Payment Integration**:
   - Connect to payment gateway
   - Add order confirmation flow

4. **Analytics**:
   - Track order completion rates
   - Monitor voice recognition accuracy
   - Measure average order time

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **WebSocket Reconnection**: Add automatic reconnection logic
2. **Audio Format**: May need to convert audio format for Whisper API
3. **Error Handling**: Add user-friendly error messages

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: May need permissions adjustment
- Mobile: Touch events supported
