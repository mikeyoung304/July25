# Broken Page Analysis
Generated: 2025-01-30

## Status: NO BROKEN PAGE FOUND

### WebSocket Error Analysis
- **Previous Error**: `webSocketService is not defined` at App.tsx:90
- **Current Status**: FIXED - webSocketService is properly imported
- **Import Added**: `import { orderUpdatesHandler, webSocketService } from '@/services/websocket'`

### Page Rendering Check
- No specific broken page component identified
- The error was in App.tsx cleanup, not a page component
- All routes appear to render (though many lack auth protection)

### Potential Issues to Address
1. **Unprotected Routes**: Server, Admin, History, Performance, Expo pages have no auth
2. **Kitchen Auth**: Uses KitchenRoute requiring specific roles
3. **No Demo UI**: No visible demo/guest access on landing page

## Conclusion
No broken page exists. The webSocketService error has been resolved.
