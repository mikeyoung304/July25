- Different sounds for:
  - New orders (ascending chime)
  - Order ready (chord)
  - Attention alerts
  - Success/error feedback
- Volume control and mute functionality
- User preference persistence

### 4. Advanced Order Filtering and Sorting ✅
- Filter by:
  - Order status (new, preparing, ready)
  - Station type (grill, fryer, salad, etc.)
  - Time range (last 15min, 30min, 1hr, today)
  - Search query (order number, table, items)
- Sort by:
  - Order time
  - Order number
  - Status
  - Table number
- Real-time filter updates
- Performance optimized with memoization

### 5. Order History View ✅
- Paginated historical order display
- Date range filtering
- Order statistics:
  - Total orders
  - Average preparation time
  - Peak hours analysis
  - Station performance metrics
- Export functionality for CSV/JSON
- Search through historical orders

### 6. Performance Monitoring ✅
- React Profiler integration
- Real-time performance metrics:
  - Component render times
  - API call latency
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Frame rate monitoring
- Performance overlay for development
- Automatic performance logging

### 7. Error Boundaries and Error Handling ✅
- Hierarchical error boundaries (page, section, component levels)
- Custom error UI for different error types
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Retry functionality for failed operations
- useErrorHandler hook for consistent error handling
- Production error logging preparation

### 8. Security Measures ✅
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- HTML entity escaping
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Content Security Policy setup
- Secure cookie configurations
- CSRF token management
- Secure storage utilities

### 9. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅
- Unit tests for:
  - Validation utilities
  - Error boundaries
  - Sound notifications
  - KDS components
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test coverage for critical paths
- Performance test considerations

### 10. TypeScript Issues Fixed ✅
- Proper type exports
- Centralized type definitions
- Fixed type casting issues
- Resolved import errors
- Type-safe implementations throughout

### 11. Accessibility Features ✅
- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Global shortcuts (Ctrl+K for Kitchen, etc.)
  - Arrow key navigation for order cards
  - Tab navigation for all interactive elements
  - Focus trap in modals
  - Skip navigation links

- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - ARIA labels on all interactive elements
  - ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Proper heading hierarchy

- **Visual Accessibility:**
  - High contrast focus indicators
  - Color not sole indicator of meaning
  - Supports 200% zoom
  - Adequate touch targets

- **Focus Management:**
  - Focus trap hook for modals
  - Focus management for order cards
  - Return focus on dialog close

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Atomic Design**: Components broken down into atoms, molecules, and organisms
2. **Composition Pattern**: Smaller components composed into larger ones
3. **Custom Hooks**: Logic extraction and reusability
4. **Memoization**: Performance optimization with React.memo and useMemo
5. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at multiple levels
6. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time order subscriptions

## Performance Optimizations
- React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for stable function references
- Virtualization ready (for large order lists)
- Debounced search inputs
- Lazy loading for routes

## Security Hardening
- Input validation on all user inputs
- XSS protection through sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure headers configuration
- CSRF protection ready
- Content Security Policy implemented

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Accessibility tests with jest-axe
- Performance benchmarks
- Manual testing checklist

## Future Enhancements
1. WebSocket integration for real-time updates
2. Push notifications for urgent orders
3. Multi-language support
4. Dark mode theme
5. Advanced analytics dashboard
6. Integration with POS systems
7. Mobile app companion
8. Voice control for hands-free operation
