# Documentation Archive - 2025-08-18

## Reason for Archival

These documents were archived during the documentation cleanup and consolidation effort following the Kitchen Display System fixes and production deployment preparation.

## Archived Files

### Voice Testing Documentation
- **Original**: `docs/testing/voice-testing.md`
- **Replaced By**: `docs/VOICE_ORDERING.md`
- **Reason**: Outdated testing procedures for legacy voice system. New documentation covers WebRTC/OpenAI Realtime implementation.

### BuildPanel Documentation
- **Location**: `docs/_archive/2025-08-12-buildpanel/`
- **Status**: Already archived
- **Reason**: Legacy implementation documentation from previous development phase

## Current Documentation Structure

The active documentation now includes:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and decisions
- `API.md` - Complete API reference
- `KITCHEN_DISPLAY.md` - Kitchen Display System guide
- `VOICE_ORDERING.md` - Consolidated voice ordering documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION.md` - Demo and production auth flows

## Migration Notes

All critical information from archived documents has been incorporated into the new documentation structure. The archived files are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development.
