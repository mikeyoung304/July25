## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. Fix remaining 31 failing tests
2. Enhance input sanitization beyond basic XSS
3. Add security headers configuration

### Medium Priority
1. Update remaining test mocks
2. Fix useOrderFilters toggle behavior
3. Add missing test coverage

### Low Priority
1. Remove remaining AI bloat patterns
2. Further consolidation opportunities
3. Performance optimization

## Key Learnings

1. **Multi-Agent Scanning Works**: Found critical issues human review might miss
2. **Security First**: XSS vulnerabilities were most critical finding
3. **Service Architecture**: Consolidation requires careful export management
4. **Test Maintenance**: UI changes require test updates
5. **Git Workflow**: Always verify remote before pushing

## Commands Used Successfully
- `/m-security-scan` - Found XSS vulnerabilities
- `/m-project-cleanup` Phase 5 - Found service issues
- `--ultrathink` - Helped identify git remote issue

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Fix Remaining Tests**: Focus on the 31 failing tests
2. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP and other headers
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify refactoring didn't impact speed
4. **Bundle Size Check**: Measure impact of consolidation
5. **Create PR**: From Jul-5 branch to main
