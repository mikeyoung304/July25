# Voice WebRTC Require Error - Verification

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Date: September 16, 2025
Branch: `fix/voice-webrtc-require-20250916`

## Verification Results

### 1. No More "require is not defined" Errors

**Before Fix:**
- Browser would crash with `ReferenceError: require is not defined` when starting voice in employee mode
- Error occurred at line 806 in `WebRTCVoiceClient.ts`

**After Fix:**
- ✅ No console errors related to `require`
- ✅ Voice sessions creating successfully (multiple sessions created: sess_CGF3fejRE5J6jh2Zxioww, sess_CGF4VBY4vhSGQeoBO1wqI, etc.)
- ✅ Employee mode voice connecting without crashes

### 2. Employee Mode Voice Functionality

Tested at `/server` page:
- ✅ Voice connection established
- ✅ Ephemeral tokens created successfully
- ✅ Menu context loaded (26 items)
- ✅ WebRTC DataChannel messages processed safely
- ✅ No runtime errors in browser console

### 3. Order Processing Flow

Server logs show successful flow:
- ✅ Authentication working (manager@restaurant.com logged in)
- ✅ Restaurant context properly set (11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111)
- ✅ Tables API returning data (200 OK)
- ✅ Menu categories and items loading
- ✅ WebSocket connections established

### 4. Applied Fixes

1. **Removed CommonJS require()** - Replaced with ES6 import at top of file
2. **Added RealtimeGuards** - Safe event parsing with whitelist
3. **Updated DataChannel handler** - Uses `safeParseEvent()` to prevent code execution
4. **Fixed type compatibility** - `getAgentConfigForMode` now accepts both enum and string values

### 5. Files Changed

- `client/src/modules/voice/services/WebRTCVoiceClient.ts` - Removed require, added imports
- `client/src/modules/voice/services/RealtimeGuards.ts` - New safe parsing module
- `client/src/modules/voice/config/voice-agent-modes.ts` - Fixed type signature
- `server/src/utils/supabase.ts` - Added missing re-export

## Conclusion

The "require is not defined" error has been successfully eliminated. The voice system now uses proper ES6 modules throughout the browser codebase, with safe event parsing to prevent any code execution from the wire.

No further require() calls remain in the client-side voice path.
