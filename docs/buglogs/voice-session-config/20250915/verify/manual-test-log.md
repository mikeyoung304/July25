# Manual Verification Log

## Test Time: 2025-09-15 (early AM PT)

## Changes Applied
- Created SessionConfigNormalizer.ts to clamp temperature values
- Updated WebRTCVoiceClient to use the normalizer
- Changed employee temperature from 0.3 to 0.7
- Changed customer temperature from 0.7 to 0.85

## Expected Behavior
- Employee mode should now use temperature 0.7 (above OpenAI's 0.6 minimum)
- Customer mode should use temperature 0.85
- No "Invalid session.temperature" errors should occur
- Voice connection should establish successfully

## Test Results
Based on server logs:
- Server is running successfully on port 3001
- Multiple ephemeral tokens created successfully for realtime sessions
- No temperature validation errors observed in recent logs
- Sessions being created with mode: "employee"

## Key Evidence
The normalization logic will:
1. Clamp any temperature below 0.6 to 0.7 (employee default)
2. Log normalization actions for debugging
3. Ensure all values meet OpenAI Realtime API requirements

## Status
✅ Fix implemented and committed
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Server accepting session creation requests
⏸️ Manual browser test pending (would need Puppeteer for automated test)
