- ❌ No health checks

## Production Readiness Checklist

### 🔴 Must Fix Before Production
- [ ] Fix status validation schemas
- [ ] Add missing status handlers
- [ ] Fix memory leaks
- [ ] Remove Node crypto from client
- [ ] Fix restaurant_id in kiosk
- [ ] Add RLS policies
- [ ] Protect webhook endpoints

### 🟡 Should Fix Soon
- [ ] Implement split payment UI
- [ ] Fix failing tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Remove orphaned files
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Add monitoring

### 🟢 Nice to Have
- [ ] Reduce bundle size
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript errors
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Document all ADRs
- [ ] Add performance tracking

## Risk Matrix

| Component | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation Priority |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Order Validation | 🔴 Critical | Orders fail | Immediate |
| KDS Status | 🔴 Critical | UI crashes | Immediate |
| Memory Leaks | 🔴 High | System crashes | Day 1 |
| Missing RLS | 🟡 High | Data breach | Day 2 |
| Test Suite | 🟡 Medium | Can't verify | Day 3 |
| Documentation | 🟢 Low | Confusion | Week 2 |

```

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Crash Rate**: Currently unknown, implement monitoring
2. **Memory Usage**: Leaking ~20-30MB per voice session
3. **Test Pass Rate**: 81.6% → Target 95%
4. **Bundle Size**: 109KB → Target <100KB
5. **Type Errors**: 560 → Target 0
6. **API Response Time**: Not measured → Target <200ms
7. **Order Success Rate**: Not tracked → Target >99%
8. **WebSocket Stability**: Reconnection storms possible

## Conclusion

The system has solid authentication architecture and a clean single voice implementation, but critical runtime issues make it **not production-ready**. The validation bugs alone would prevent any new orders from being created. With focused effort on the P0 issues, the system could reach production-ready state in 3-5 days.
