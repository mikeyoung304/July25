# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Delta Report
Generated: 2025-01-15

## Current ADR Status

### Existing ADRs
| Number | File | Topic | Last Modified | Status |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| ADR-001 | ADR-001-authentication.md | Authentication | 2025-09-14 | ACTIVE |
| ADR-002 | ADR-002-unified-backend.md | Unified Backend | 2025-09-14 | ACTIVE |
| ADR-003 | ADR-003-cart-unification.md | Cart Unification | 2025-09-14 | ACTIVE |
| ADR-004 | ADR-004-voice-system-consolidation.md | Voice System | 2025-09-14 | ACTIVE |
| ADR-007 | ADR-007-order-status-alignment.md | Order Status | 2025-09-14 | CONFLICT |
| ADR-007 | ADR-007-unified-auth-normalization.md | Auth Normalization | 2025-09-14 | CONFLICT |

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Duplicate ADR Number (ADR-007)
**Issue**: Two different ADR files with the same number
- `ADR-007-order-status-alignment.md` - Documents order status standardization
- `ADR-007-unified-auth-normalization.md` - Documents auth normalization

**Impact**: Confusion in architectural decisions, potential conflicts in implementation
**Recommendation**: Renumber one to ADR-008

### 2. Missing ADR Numbers
**Gap**: ADR-005 and ADR-006 are missing
**Possible Scenarios**:
- Never created (numbering jumped)
- Deleted without archiving
- Lost during migration

**Recommendation**:
- Check git history for deleted ADRs
- Document why numbers were skipped or restore missing files

## ADR Coverage Gaps

### Documented Decisions
✅ Authentication strategy
✅ Backend unification
✅ Cart system consolidation
✅ Voice system architecture
✅ Order status handling
✅ Auth normalization

### Missing ADR Documentation
❌ Database architecture (Supabase integration)
❌ Payment system architecture
❌ WebSocket/real-time strategy
❌ Testing framework migration (Jest → Vitest)
❌ Multi-tenancy implementation
❌ Kitchen Display System (KDS) architecture
❌ Error handling strategy
❌ Deployment architecture
❌ Security architecture
❌ API versioning strategy

## Implementation vs. ADR Alignment

### ADR-001 (Authentication)
**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ JWT token infrastructure
- ✅ Supabase integration
- ❌ PIN code authentication (mentioned but not fully implemented)
- ❌ MFA support (documented but not implemented)

### ADR-002 (Unified Backend)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Single backend on port 3001
- ✅ Express server consolidation

### ADR-003 (Cart Unification)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ UnifiedCartContext created
- ✅ Single cart provider pattern

### ADR-004 (Voice System)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ WebRTC + OpenAI Realtime API
- ✅ Removed competing implementations

### ADR-007 (Order Status)
**Status**: UNCLEAR DUE TO CONFLICT
- Need to determine which ADR-007 is authoritative

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Resolve ADR-007 Conflict**
   - Review both files to determine priority
   - Renumber one to ADR-008
   - Update references in code/docs

2. **Document Missing Numbers**
   - Add ADR-005-SKIPPED.md explaining gap
   - Add ADR-006-SKIPPED.md explaining gap
   - Or recover from git history

3. **Create Missing Critical ADRs**
   - ADR-009: Database Architecture
   - ADR-010: Payment Processing
   - ADR-011: Real-time WebSocket Strategy
   - ADR-012: Testing Framework Migration

### Process Improvements
1. **ADR Template**: Create standard template for consistency
2. **ADR Index**: Maintain index file linking all ADRs
3. **ADR Reviews**: Require review before implementation
4. **ADR Updates**: Mark ADRs as SUPERSEDED when replaced

## Historical ADR References Found

### In Archives
- Multiple references to authentication decisions in archive/2025-01-30/
- Voice system evolution documented across multiple archive dates
- Cart unification history in archive/2025-01-26/

### Implementation Drift
- Several architectural decisions implemented without ADRs
- Some ADRs created after implementation (retrofit documentation)
- ADR process appears to have started late in project lifecycle

## Summary

**Total ADRs**: 6 files (5 unique numbers due to conflict)
**Missing Numbers**: 2 (ADR-005, ADR-006)
**Conflicts**: 1 (duplicate ADR-007)
**Coverage**: ~30% of major architectural decisions documented
**Health Score**: 3/10 (Needs significant improvement)

**Next Steps**:
1. Resolve ADR-007 conflict immediately
2. Create ADR index file
3. Document missing architectural decisions
4. Establish ADR review process for future changes
