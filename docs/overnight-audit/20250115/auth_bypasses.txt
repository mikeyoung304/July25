# Authentication Bypass Detection Report

## CRITICAL FINDINGS: NONE
No production authentication bypasses detected.

## Development-Only Bypasses (WITH SAFEGUARDS)

### 1. Restaurant Membership Bypass
Location: server/src/middleware/auth.ts:334-358
Condition: NODE_ENV=development OR BYPASS_RESTAURANT_MEMBERSHIP=true
Impact: Allows staff to access restaurants they're not assigned to
Safeguards:
- Still requires valid authentication
- Logs warning when activated
- Only affects restaurant access, not authentication

### 2. Test Token Rejection
Location: server/src/middleware/auth.ts:112-115
Behavior: Explicitly REJECTS "test-token" string
Protection: Logs error and returns Unauthorized

Location: server/src/services/auth/AuthenticationService.ts:148-150
Behavior: Rejects test tokens in production
Protection: Only allows in non-production environments

## Token Types Detected (ALL VALIDATED)

### Supabase Tokens (RS256)
- Detection: issuer includes "supabase.co"
- Validation: JWT verification with SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
- Role Resolution: Queries user_restaurants table for actual role

### Kiosk/Demo Tokens (HS256)
- Detection: sub starts with "customer:", "demo:", or "kiosk:"
- Validation: JWT verification with KIOSK_JWT_SECRET
- Scope: Limited to customer operations

### PIN Tokens
- Detection: auth_method = "pin"
- Validation: JWT verification with appropriate secret
- Scope: Staff operations within assigned restaurant

### Station Tokens
- Detection: auth_method = "station"
- Validation: JWT verification with appropriate secret
- Scope: Kitchen/expo display operations

## Webhook Endpoints (UNPROTECTED BUT VALIDATED)

### Square Webhook (/api/v1/webhooks/square)
- No authentication required (by design)
- Validates webhook signature from Square

### Stripe Webhook (/api/v1/webhooks/stripe)
- No authentication required (by design)
- Validates webhook signature from Stripe

### Payment Webhook (/api/v1/payments/webhooks/payments)
- No authentication required (by design)
- Should validate webhook signatures

## Recommendations

1. Add webhook signature validation to payment webhook endpoint
2. Consider adding IP allowlisting for webhook endpoints
3. Add monitoring/alerting for development bypass usage
4. Rotate JWT secrets regularly
5. Consider implementing JWT blacklist for logout

## Summary
✅ No hardcoded tokens or backdoors found
✅ All authentication paths require valid JWT
✅ Test tokens explicitly rejected
✅ Development bypasses properly gated and logged
