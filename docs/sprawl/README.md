# Documentation Sprawl Archive

This directory contains documentation that was moved here during the cleanup effort. These documents are less essential for day-to-day development but retained for historical reference.

## Moved Documents

### From Root Directory
- `API_ENDPOINTS.md` - Duplicate of docs/API.md
- `AUDIT_SNAPSHOT.md` - Historical audit from previous session
- `FLOOR_PLAN_SETUP.md` - Specific floor plan configuration
- `MONITORING.md` - Overlaps with PRODUCTION_MONITORING.md
- `ORDER_SYSTEM_ALIGNMENT.md` - Historical alignment notes
- `pr-description.md` - Old PR description
- `QUICK_START.md` - Duplicates README quick start
- `SYSTEM_STATE.md` - Point-in-time snapshot
- `TEST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Test details (covered in main docs)

### From docs/ Directory
- `AI_COST_PROJECTIONS.md` - Cost estimates
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Outdated index
- `LEAN_CODEBASE_CHECKLIST.md` - Historical checklist
- `MCP-STATUS.md` - MCP implementation status
- `PRODUCTION_MONITORING.md` - Production monitoring details
- `UNIFIED_COMPONENTS.md` - Component unification notes

## Why These Were Moved

1. **Duplication**: Many documents duplicated information in core docs
2. **Historical**: Some were point-in-time snapshots no longer current
3. **Specificity**: Very specific implementation details not needed for general development
4. **Consolidation**: Information better consolidated into main documentation

## Core Documentation Remains

The essential documentation remains in place:
- Root: README, ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, CONTRIBUTING_AI, DEPLOYMENT, CHANGELOG
- docs/: API, FEATURES, VOICE_ORDERING_GUIDE, ACCESSIBILITY, MCP, backend-swap
