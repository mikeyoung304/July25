# Vercel Environment Variable Fix
*Date: 2025-09-26*
*Issue: Production deployment showing "Configuration Required" error*

## Problem
The deployed site at https://july25-client.vercel.app was showing a "Configuration Required" error screen instead of the application.

## Root Cause
Missing `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel production environment.

The app checks for these required environment variables in `client/src/App.tsx`:
- VITE_API_BASE_URL ❌ (was missing)
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL ✅
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY ✅

If any are missing, it displays the SetupRequiredScreen.

## Solution Applied
1. Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to Vercel production environment:
   ```bash
   echo "https://july25.onrender.com" | vercel env add VITE_API_BASE_URL production
   ```

2. Triggered redeployment:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Current Status
✅ All required environment variables are now configured:
- VITE_API_BASE_URL → https://july25.onrender.com
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL → [Encrypted]
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY → [Encrypted]
- VITE_DEFAULT_RESTAURANT_ID → [Encrypted]
- VITE_DEMO_PANEL → 1

✅ Site is now live and working at: https://july25-client.vercel.app

## Prevention
- Always verify environment variables after deployment
- Use `vercel env ls production` to check current variables
- Refer to docs/ENVIRONMENT.md for complete list of required variables
