# Project Janus - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Summary

We have successfully implemented the connection foundation for integrating with Luis's Express.js backend. The frontend is now ready to communicate with the backend API following Luis's exact specifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced HTTP Client (`src/services/http/httpClient.ts`)
- ✅ Automatic Supabase JWT authentication in `Authorization: Bearer` header
- ✅ Restaurant ID in `X-Restaurant-ID` header for multi-tenancy
- ✅ Automatic camelCase ↔ snake_case transformation
- ✅ Status code-based error handling (no envelope)
- ✅ Integration with existing SecureAPIClient for security features

### 2. Case Transformation Utilities (`src/services/utils/caseTransform.ts`)
- ✅ Deep object transformation between camelCase and snake_case
- ✅ Handles nested objects, arrays, and special types
- ✅ ISO date string to Date object conversion
- ✅ Query parameter transformation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (15/15 tests passing)

### 3. HttpServiceAdapter Pattern (`src/services/base/HttpServiceAdapter.ts`)
- ✅ Base class for gradual service migration
- ✅ Automatic mock/real mode switching
- ✅ Graceful fallback to mock data in development
- ✅ Standardized error handling and logging

### 4. OrderService Migration (`src/services/orders/OrderService.migrated.ts`)
- ✅ Pilot implementation using the new pattern
- ✅ All CRUD operations adapted for real API
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Ready for testing with Luis's endpoints

### 5. RestaurantIdProvider Integration
- ✅ Added to App.tsx to sync RestaurantContext with HTTP client
- ✅ Ensures all API calls include the correct restaurant ID

## Key Features

### Automatic Request Transformation
```typescript
// Frontend sends:
{ 
  orderNumber: "001", 
  tableNumber: "5",
  orderTime: new Date()
}

// Transformed to snake_case for backend:
{ 
  order_number: "001", 
  table_number: "5",
  order_time: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Automatic Response Transformation
```typescript
// Backend returns:
{ 
  restaurant_id: "rest-1",
  created_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}

// Transformed to camelCase for frontend:
{ 
  restaurantId: "rest-1",
  createdAt: Date object
}
```

## Testing Luis's Integration

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
# .env.local
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001  # Luis's Express server
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false                  # Switch to real API
```

### 2. Test with OrderService
```typescript
// The service will now make real API calls
const { orders } = await orderService.getOrders('rest-1', { status: 'new' })
```

### 3. Expected API Request
```
GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/orders?status=new
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>
  X-Restaurant-ID: rest-1
  Content-Type: application/json
```

## Next Steps

With the connection foundation complete, we can now proceed to:

1. **Phase 2**: Fix Kitchen Display performance and complete Floor Plan editor
2. **Phase 3**: Implement WebSocket service for real-time updates
3. **Phase 4**: Migrate all remaining services to use the new pattern

## For Luis

The frontend is ready to connect to your Express.js backend. We need:

1. **Base URL** of your development server
2. **One or two GET endpoints** to test (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`)
3. **CORS configuration** to allow:
   - Origin: `http://localhost:5173` (or your frontend URL)
   - Headers: `Authorization`, `X-Restaurant-ID`, `Content-Type`

Once we have a working endpoint, we can validate the integration and proceed with migrating all services.
