   - Executive summary of the crisis
   - Metrics: 64.75/100 → 95/100 score
   - 884 → 30 broken links (97.4% health)
   - Complete timeline and key deliverables
   - Cost analysis and ROI

2. PATTERNS.md (26KB) - Recognition
   - 7 common documentation drift patterns
   - Link rot, API drift, missing ADRs, staleness
   - How each manifests and why it happens
   - Detection signs and prevention strategies
   - Real examples from Restaurant OS

3. INCIDENTS.md (19KB) - History
   - 5 major documentation incidents
   - Detailed timeline and impact
   - Root cause analysis (5 Whys)
   - Resolution steps and costs
   - Lessons learned from each

4. PREVENTION.md (21KB) - Solutions
   - 10 prevention strategies implemented
   - Automated link validation
   - API documentation generation (planned)
   - ADR requirements and templates

5. QUICK-REFERENCE.md (8KB) - Cheat Sheet
   - Fast lookup for common tasks
   - Pre-commit/PR checklists
   - Common commands

6. AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md (18KB) - AI Guidelines
   - Core principles for AI agents
   - When to create documentation
   - Common scenarios (adding API, refactoring, etc.)
   - Anti-patterns to avoid
   - Validation checklists
   - Key lessons from crisis

TOTAL SIZE: 114KB of documentation

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- Link rot compounds exponentially (50 → 884 in 4 months)
- Manual API docs don't scale (42% accuracy after 3 months)
- Undocumented decisions decay (80+ hours of work lost)
- Prevention is 10x cheaper than repair (6 hrs/yr vs 40 hrs emergency)

AUTOMATION IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ Link validation in CI/CD
- ✅ Weekly scheduled health checks
- ✅ Stale documentation detection
- ✅ Documentation templates
- ⚠️ API generation from code (planned)
- ⚠️ Schema doc generation (planned)

READ ORDER:
1. Start with README.md for overview
2. Read PATTERNS.md to recognize drift
3. Check INCIDENTS.md for historical context
4. Study PREVENTION.md for solutions
5. Use QUICK-REFERENCE.md for daily work
6. AI agents: Read AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md
