# ðŸ”„ Migration Notice - January 2025

## Project is Now Self-Contained! ðŸŽ‰

### What Changed?
We've successfully migrated all AI Gateway functionality into the main project. The external `macon-ai-gateway` directory is **no longer needed**.

### Action Required:
You can safely delete the `../macon-ai-gateway` directory - it's no longer used.

### New Structure:
```
rebuild-6.0/
â”œâ”€â”€ ai-gateway-websocket.js    # Main AI Gateway with voice support
â”œâ”€â”€ ai-gateway-voiceHandler.js # Voice processing handler
â”œâ”€â”€ start-unified-dev.js       # Single startup script
â””â”€â”€ src/                       # All frontend code
```

### Benefits:
- âœ… Single repository
- âœ… One `npm install` for everything
- âœ… Consistent ES modules throughout
- âœ… No external dependencies
- âœ… Simpler deployment

### How to Start:
```bash
npm install  # Get all dependencies
npm run dev:ai  # Start everything
```

### Archived Files:
Old utility scripts have been moved to `_archive_old_scripts/` and can be deleted once you confirm everything works.

**Note**: This change makes the project easier to share, deploy, and maintain. No more confusion about external directories!
