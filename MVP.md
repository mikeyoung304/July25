# MVP - Minimal Viable Pages Plan

## Mission Statement
Strip every page down to its core function. If it doesn't directly support the page's primary purpose, remove it. The Dashboard is our touchstone of greatness - clean, purposeful, minimal.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Function over form** - Remove all decorative elements
2. **One navigation path** - Single "Back to Dashboard" component everywhere
3. **No redundancy** - If it exists elsewhere, don't duplicate it
4. **Zero animations** - Remove all motion/transitions
5. **Silent operation** - Remove all console logs and debug panels

## Instructions for AI Assistants
- **Update this file** as you complete each task
- Mark items with ✅ when complete
- Add the date and any notes about what was removed
- If you find additional bloat not listed, add it to the plan
- Test after each page cleanup to ensure core functionality remains

## Phase 1: Create Reusable Components
- ✅ Create `client/src/components/navigation/BackToDashboard.tsx` - 2025-08-21
  - Simple arrow icon + "Dashboard" text
