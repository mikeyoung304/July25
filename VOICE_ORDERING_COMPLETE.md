# ✅ Voice Ordering Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What We Built

Two fully functional voice ordering interfaces:
1. **Kiosk** - Split-screen for in-store ordering
2. **Drive-Thru** - Large-text interface for vehicles

## 🚀 The Optimal Way to Use It

```bash
npm run dev:ai
```

**One command, everything starts.** No multiple terminals, no confusion.

## 📱 What You Can Do

1. **Test Voice Ordering**
   - Hold the "HOLD ME" button while speaking
   - Watch orders build in real-time
   - See AI responses and suggestions

2. **Try Different Scenarios**
   - "I'll have a bacon burger"
   - "Make that two, and add fries"
   - "No pickles on one of them"
   - "What desserts do you have?"

3. **Test Both Interfaces**
   - Kiosk: Professional split-screen
   - Drive-Thru: Extra-large for visibility
