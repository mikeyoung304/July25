# E2E Voice Ordering Test - Findings Report

**Test Target**: https://july25-client.vercel.app
**Commit SHA**: a29ca8e8a16ff5be1dace768c0ec0394195e49cf
**Test Date**: 2025-10-16T17:08:42Z
**Test Duration**: 6.4 minutes (382 seconds)
**Result**: ❌ **FAIL**

---

## Executive Summary

E2E voice ordering test failed due to **authentication flow mismatch**. The test assumed traditional email/password login, but the deployed application uses **Demo Mode** with role-based quick access buttons that auto-authenticate users without credential entry.

Neither Playwright (2 passes) nor Puppeteer cross-check successfully navigated to the voice ordering interface.

---

## Phase Results

### ✅ Phase A: Preflight
- **BASE_URL connectivity**: 200 OK
- **Environment captured**: Node v24.2.0, npm 11.3.0, Playwright 1.54.2
- **Test audio generated**: `assets/voice_samples/margherita.wav` (96KB, 16-bit PCM mono WAV)

### ❌ Phase B: Playwright Tests (2 passes)

#### Run 1: Normal Network
- **Status**: Failed after 3.2 minutes
- **Error**: `Test timeout of 180000ms exceeded`
- **Failure Point**: `locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` waiting for `input[type="email"]`
- **Root Cause**: No email input exists on homepage; application uses Demo Mode role selection

#### Run 2: Degraded Network (3G simulation)
- **Status**: Failed after 3.1 minutes
- **Error**: Same as Run 1
- **Network Conditions**: 400ms latency, 75KB/s down, 35KB/s up (cellular3g)

### ⚠️  Phase C: Puppeteer Cross-Check
- **Status**: Partial - identified authentication flow but did not complete voice test
- **Discovery**: Successfully clicked Server role button → auto-authenticated as server@restaurant.com
- **Navigation**: Reached workspace selector (Server/Kitchen/Kiosk/Admin/Expo cards)
- **Incomplete**: Did not navigate into Server workspace or locate voice ordering UI

### ❌ Phase D: Voice Ordering Validation
- **WebSocket Auth**: Not tested (did not reach voice interface)
- **Transcript Detection**: Not tested
- **Order UI Update**: Not tested

## Root Cause Analysis

### AUTH/FLOW Mismatch

**Expected Flow (per test design)**:
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Fill email input field
3. Fill password input field
4. Click "Sign In" button
5. Assert logged-in state

**Actual Flow (discovered via Puppeteer)**:
1. Navigate to homepage → shows "Quick Demo Access" with role buttons
2. Click role button (Manager/Server/Kitchen/Expo/Cashier)
3. User is **auto-authenticated** (e.g., server@restaurant.com)
4. Workspace selector appears with clickable workspace cards
5. Click workspace card (e.g., "Server") to enter workspace
6. Look for voice ordering controls within workspace

**Key Difference**: No traditional login form on homepage. Demo Mode enables instant role-based access.

### UI/NAV Observations

From Puppeteer screenshots:
- **Homepage** (after splash): Shows "Staff Access" section with 5 role buttons and "Demo Mode • Password: Demo123!" banner
- **Post-Auth**: User dropdown shows "server" with email server@restaurant.com, "Session active", and restaurant ID
- **Workspace Selector**: 6 large cards (Server, Kitchen, Kiosk, Online Order, Admin, Expo)

## Minimal Repro Steps

To reproduce the authentication flow issue:

1. Open https://july25-client.vercel.app in browser
2. Wait 5.5 seconds for splash screen to dismiss
3. **Observe**: No email/password form visible on main page
4. **Observe**: "Quick Demo Access" section with role buttons (Manager, Server, Kitchen, Expo, Cashier)
5. Click "Server" button
6. **Observe**: User is auto-authenticated as server@restaurant.com without credential entry
7. **Observe**: Workspace selector screen appears
8. Attempt to locate email input with selector `input[type="email"]` → **FAILS** (element does not exist)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Update Test Selectors & Flow

Modify `tests/e2e/voice-order.spec.ts` B3 (Login) section:

```typescript
// OLD (incorrect)
const emailInput = page.locator('input[type="email"]').first();
await emailInput.fill(TEST_EMAIL);
// ...

// NEW (correct for Demo Mode)
const serverRoleBtn = page.locator('button:has-text("Server")').first();
await serverRoleBtn.click();
await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Wait for auto-auth

// Assert logged in
await expect(page.locator('text=server@restaurant.com')).toBeVisible();
```

### 2. Navigate to Server Workspace

Add step B4.5 to actually enter the Server workspace:

```typescript
// Click the Server workspace card (not the role button)
const serverWorkspaceCard = page.locator('div, button, a')
  .filter({ hasText: 'Server' })
  .filter({ has: page.locator('svg, img') }) // Has icon
  .first();
await serverWorkspaceCard.click();
await page.waitForTimeout(3000); // Wait for workspace load
```

### 3. Locate Voice Ordering UI

Once inside Server workspace:
- Inspect the UI for voice/microphone controls
- Look for buttons with text: "Voice", "Start", "Connect", "Record"
- Check for data-test attributes: `[data-test="voice-button"]`, `[data-test="start-voice"]`
- Update test selectors based on actual implementation

### 4. Alternative: Test Against /login Route

If testing traditional email/password flow is required:

```typescript
await page.goto('https://july25-client.vercel.app/login');
// Now email/password inputs should be available
```

Screenshot evidence shows `/login` route does have traditional email/password form.

## Failure Bucket Classification

| Category | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **AUTH/WS** | ❌ Failed | Incorrect auth flow assumptions; WebSocket not tested |
| **MIC/WEBRTC** | ⚠️  Not Tested | Did not reach voice interface |
| **VOICE/ASR** | ⚠️  Not Tested | Audio not injected; no transcripts observed |
| **UI/ORDER** | ⚠️  Not Tested | Did not reach ordering interface |

---

## Additional Notes

### Demo Mode Discovery

The application is running in **Demo Mode** with temporary access enabled:
- Banner text: "Demo Mode • Password: Demo123!"
- Role buttons provide instant authentication
- Credentials: server@restaurant.com, manager@restaurant.com, etc.
- Session shows restaurant ID: 11111111...

### Splash Screen Handling

Splash screen handling worked correctly:
- 5.5s wait successfully covered the splash delay
- No selectors found for splash element (already hidden)

### Network Degradation

3G network simulation was successfully applied in Pass 2:
- 400ms latency
- 75KB/s download
- 35KB/s upload
- Same failure occurred, indicating auth flow issue not network-related

---

## Conclusion

The E2E voice ordering test suite requires a complete rewrite of the authentication flow (Phase B3) to match the actual Demo Mode architecture. Once corrected, the test should successfully:

1. Click Server role button → auto-authenticate
2. Navigate into Server workspace
3. Locate voice ordering controls
4. Inject fake audio via `--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture`
5. Validate transcripts, WebSocket communication, and order UI updates

**Current Blocker**: Test design assumes traditional login form that does not exist on the deployed homepage.
