## Key Findings

### ✅ Highly Verified Areas
1. **Square Payment Integration** (85% verified)
   - SDK v43 usage, authentication format, idempotency keys, server validation all confirmed

2. **Order Status Management** (verified across multiple files)
   - 8 order statuses consistently defined in shared types
   - Used throughout ORDER_FLOW.md and KDS-BIBLE.md

3. **Authentication Architecture**
   - WebSocket auth, Supabase signInWithPassword, race condition prevention verified

4. **API Endpoints**
   - POST /api/v1/orders, POST /api/v1/payments/create, GET /api/v1/menu/items all confirmed

### ⚠️ Weakly Verified Areas
1. **Configuration Files**
   - Many npm scripts, tsconfig settings, eslint configs referenced but not verified

2. **Cache Implementation**
   - 5-minute cache documented but cache.service.ts not found

3. **Voice Ordering Specs**
   - Audio formats, token lifetimes, latency metrics documented but not code-confirmed

4. **Testing & CI**
   - Coverage percentages, bundle sizes, quality gates documented but not verified against actual configs

### ❌ Missing Evidence (Only 4 Claims)
1. `/scripts/validate-square-credentials.sh` script
2. WebSocket rate limiting implementation
3. Model names (gpt-5-codex) in AGENTS.md
4. Some environment variable validations

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Verify cache.service.ts exists** - Multiple docs reference it but file not found
2. **Confirm WebSocket rate limiting** - Documented but no code found
3. **Validate Square credential script** - Referenced in 2 docs but missing

### Medium Priority
1. **Document heartbeat interval consistency** - 30s vs 60s conflict between KDS-BIBLE.md and WEBSOCKET_EVENTS.md
2. **Verify npm script commands** - Many documented but not package.json verified
3. **Confirm auth endpoint removal** - MIGRATION_V6_AUTH.md says /login removed but may still exist

### Low Priority
1. **Add code comments linking to docs** - Help future developers find relevant documentation
2. **Generate VERSION.md** - Automatically sync with package.json versions
3. **Add CI tests for documentation claims** - Prevent docs from becoming stale

---

## Methodology

This analysis used the following approach:

1. **Claim Extraction**: Extracted 5-15 key technical claims per document (focusing on verifiable statements)
2. **Evidence Search**: Used `grep` to search for:
   - Function names, class names, types
   - File paths, configuration values
   - API endpoints, WebSocket events
   - Environment variables
3. **Classification**:
   - **Verified**: Found exact match (function definition, config value, type definition)
   - **Weak**: Found related code (file exists, similar pattern) but not exact match
   - **No Evidence**: No matching code found after thorough search
