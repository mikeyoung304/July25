## Violations Summary

### Category: Orphaned Files (18 total)

All 18 violations are **legacy duplicate files** documented in `reports/orphan_triage_result.md` as future cleanup. None are critical to documentation integrity.

#### Root-Level Duplicates (12 files)
Older versions superseded by canonical `docs/*` files:

- docs/README.md → Review (docs directory README)

#### Misplaced Reports (1 file)

- server/src/routes/docs/reports/overnight/env_presence.md → Relocate to reports/ or archive

**Critical violations**: 0

## Suggested One-Liners to Fix

### Quick Fix: Archive Root Duplicates
```bash
# Create archive directory for legacy root files
mkdir -p docs/archive/legacy-root

# Archive root-level duplicates (verify canonical docs/* exist first)
for file in ARCHITECTURE.md AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md CHANGELOG.md \
            DEPLOYMENT.md ENVIRONMENT.md GETTING_STARTED.md KDS_ORDER_FLOW.md \
            PRODUCTION_STATUS.md ROADMAP.md SECURITY.md TROUBLESHOOTING.md VERSION.md; do
  if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -f "docs/$file" ]; then
    git mv "$file" "docs/archive/legacy-root/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_$file"
  fi
done

git commit -m "chore: archive legacy root-level documentation duplicates"
```

### Quick Fix: Archive Kitchen Fix Docs
```bash
# Archive dated fix documentation
git mv KITCHEN_FIX_SUMMARY.md docs/archive/incidents/
git mv KITCHEN_DISPLAY_UPGRADE.md docs/archive/incidents/
git mv client/src/modules/kitchen/PERFORMANCE-FIX.md docs/archive/incidents/

git commit -m "chore: archive dated kitchen fix documentation"
```

### Quick Fix: Meta Docs Review
```bash
# Review and decide on meta docs
# Option 1: Link from root index.md
# Option 2: Archive if redundant

# For docs/README.md - if it's useful for docs/ contributors, exempt it
# For docs/index.md - likely redundant with root index.md, can archive
```

## Recommendation

**Proceed to Phase 6-7**: The 18 remaining orphans are documented cleanup items, not critical violations. All CRITICAL guardrails (stubs, risks, anchors, reality greps) are green.

**Post-PR Cleanup**: Create follow-up issue/PR to archive the 18 legacy files using suggested one-liners above.

---

**Assessment**: Documentation integrity is strong. Remaining orphans are legacy cruft, not missing documentation or broken references.
