RLS STATUS CHECK
============================================================
Status: UNABLE TO VERIFY - Direct database connection not available

Attempted to check RLS status for critical tables:
- orders
- order_status_history  
- user_restaurants

Error: Direct connection to db.xiwfhcikfdoshxwbtjxt.supabase.co failed
- DNS resolution failed (ENOTFOUND)
- The database host may only be accessible via Supabase API or from allowed IPs
- Supabase CLI works through API gateway, not direct database connection

RECOMMENDATION:
RLS status should be verified through:
1. Supabase Dashboard (Table Editor â†’ RLS policies)
2. Supabase CLI with proper project linking
3. From a server/environment with database access
