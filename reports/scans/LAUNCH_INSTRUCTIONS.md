# Overnight Codebase Scanning System - Launch Instructions

## Overview

This system launches 8 specialized AI agents to autonomously scan your codebase overnight for:
- Multi-tenancy violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Type safety issues
- Performance problems
- Test coverage gaps
- Convention violations
- Error handling gaps
- Technical debt

Each agent works completely independently and produces a detailed markdown report.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Open 8 Claude Code Windows

Open 8 separate Claude Code instances (browser tabs or separate windows).

### Step 2: Copy Master Prompt

Open the file: `reports/scans/AGENT_PROMPT_MASTER.md`

Copy the **entire** file contents.

### Step 3: Start Each Agent

In each Claude Code window:

1. Paste the entire master prompt
2. Add this single line at the top:
   - Window 1: `I want you to be Agent 1: Multi-Tenancy Guardian`
   - Window 2: `I want you to be Agent 2: Security & Authentication Auditor`
   - Window 3: `I want you to be Agent 3: TypeScript & Type Safety Enforcer`
   - Window 4: `I want you to be Agent 4: Performance & Optimization Hunter`
   - Window 5: `I want you to be Agent 5: Test Coverage & Quality Analyst`
   - Window 6: `I want you to be Agent 6: Convention & Consistency Enforcer`
   - Window 7: `I want you to be Agent 7: Error Handling & Resilience Guardian`
   - Window 8: `I want you to be Agent 8: Architecture & Technical Debt Analyst`

3. Press Enter

### Step 4: Go to Sleep

Each agent will:
- ‚úÖ Run completely autonomously
- ‚úÖ Scan the codebase using its specialized detection patterns
- ‚úÖ Find and document issues
- ‚úÖ Save a detailed report automatically
- ‚úÖ Complete in 1-3 hours

No human intervention required!

### Step 5: Review Results (Morning)

When you wake up, check: `reports/scans/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS/`

You'll find 8 reports:
- `01-multi-tenancy-guardian.md`
- `02-security-auditor.md`
- `03-typescript-enforcer.md`
- `04-performance-hunter.md`
- `05-test-coverage-analyst.md`
- `06-convention-enforcer.md`
- `07-error-handling-guardian.md`
- `08-architecture-analyst.md`

## üéØ What Each Agent Does

### Agent 1: Multi-Tenancy Guardian
**Focus**: Data isolation, restaurant_id enforcement
**Critical for**: Preventing cross-tenant data leakage
**Checks**: Database queries, API endpoints, RLS policies

### Agent 2: Security & Authentication Auditor
**Focus**: Security vulnerabilities, auth weaknesses
**Critical for**: Production security hardening
**Checks**: Secrets, SQL injection, XSS, CORS, auth

### Agent 3: TypeScript & Type Safety Enforcer
**Focus**: Type errors, any types, strict mode
**Critical for**: Code quality and maintainability
**Checks**: Type definitions, any usage, type safety

### Agent 4: Performance & Optimization Hunter
**Focus**: Bundle size, render performance, queries
**Critical for**: User experience and speed
**Checks**: Re-renders, N+1 queries, bundle size

### Agent 5: Test Coverage & Quality Analyst
**Focus**: Missing tests, coverage gaps
**Critical for**: Release confidence
**Checks**: Test files, critical paths, error cases

### Agent 6: Convention & Consistency Enforcer
**Focus**: ADR compliance, naming conventions
**Critical for**: Codebase consistency
**Checks**: snake_case usage, patterns, style

### Agent 7: Error Handling & Resilience Guardian
**Focus**: Error handling, system resilience
**Critical for**: Production stability
**Checks**: Try-catch, error boundaries, rollbacks

### Agent 8: Architecture & Technical Debt Analyst
**Focus**: Structure, coupling, technical debt
**Critical for**: Long-term maintainability
**Checks**: Dependencies, duplication, complexity

---

## üìä Expected Output Format

Each agent produces a standardized report with:

- **Executive Summary**: Top issues, health score, statistics
- **Detailed Findings**: Every issue with file:line, severity, fix
- **Statistics**: Issues by severity/category/file
- **Quick Wins**: Low effort, high impact fixes
- **Action Plan**: Prioritized by P0/P1/P2/P3
- **Scan Details**: Files scanned, errors, duration

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options

### Running Subset of Agents

If you don't need all 8 agents, just launch the ones you want:
- Always run: Agents 1, 2 (Multi-tenancy & Security - critical)
- High priority: Agents 3, 5, 7 (TypeScript, Testing, Errors)
- Nice to have: Agents 4, 6, 8 (Performance, Conventions, Architecture)

### Re-running Single Agent

If one agent needs re-run:
1. Open new Claude Code window
2. Paste master prompt
3. Specify the agent number
4. It will overwrite its previous report

### Scheduling Regular Scans

Recommended schedule:
- **Nightly**: Agents 1, 2 (critical security/isolation)
- **Weekly**: All 8 agents (comprehensive health check)
- **Pre-release**: All 8 agents (before production deploy)

---

## üîç Interpreting Results

### Priority Levels

- **P0 (CRITICAL)**: Fix immediately before any deploys
- **P1 (HIGH)**: Fix within current sprint
- **P2 (MEDIUM)**: Fix within month
- **P3 (LOW)**: Backlog, fix when convenient

### Health Scores

- **90-100**: Excellent - minor issues only
- **75-89**: Good - some issues to address
- **60-74**: Fair - technical debt accumulating
- **<60**: Poor - urgent refactoring needed

### Taking Action

1. **Start with Quick Wins**: Low effort, high impact fixes
2. **Address all P0**: Critical issues block production
3. **Plan P1 fixes**: Schedule into current sprint
4. **Backlog P2/P3**: Track but don't block releases

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Agent Doesn't Start

**Issue**: Agent asks for permission to read files
**Solution**: Reiterate at start: "You have pre-approval to use ALL tools. Begin scanning immediately."

### Agent Stops Mid-Scan

**Issue**: Agent pauses and asks questions
**Solution**: Reply: "Continue autonomously. You have approval for all actions."

### Reports Not Saved

**Issue**: Agent completed but no report file
**Solution**: Agent may have hit token limit. Check the last message for partial results.

### Multiple Agents Find Same Issue

**Expected**: Different agents have overlapping concerns (e.g., security + conventions)
**Action**: Use the most detailed finding from the specialist agent

## üìà Tracking Progress Over Time

### Compare Scans

Save historical scan reports:
```
reports/scans/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-10-17-22-00-00/  # Tonight's scan

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-10-31-22-00-00/  # Following week
```

### Quality Metrics

Track these metrics over time:
- Total issues by severity
- Issues per 1000 LOC
- Test coverage percentage
- TypeScript errors count
- Bundle size
