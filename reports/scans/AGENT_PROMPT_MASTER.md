## üéØ PROJECT CONTEXT

### System Overview
- **Name**: Restaurant OS (Grow App)
- **Version**: 6.0.8
- **Stack**: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Express, Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS with real-time WebSocket communication
- **Purpose**: Full-stack restaurant management with AI voice ordering, KDS, payments

### Critical Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Tenancy (ADR-002) - SACRED RULE
- **EVERY** database operation MUST include `.eq('restaurant_id', ...)`
- **EVERY** API endpoint MUST validate `req.user.restaurant_id`
- RLS policies enforce tenant isolation at database level
- Test with multiple restaurant IDs: `11111111...`, `22222222...`

#### 2. Snake_case Convention (ADR-001) - ENTERPRISE STANDARD
- Database: snake_case (`restaurant_id`, `order_status`)
- API: snake_case (no camelCase transformations)
- Client: snake_case (uniform throughout stack)
- **ZERO** transformations between formats

#### 3. Dual Authentication Pattern (ADR-006)
- **Supabase Sessions** (Primary): Email/password, production-ready
- **localStorage Sessions** (Fallback): Demo/PIN/station auth
- httpClient handles both paths automatically
- Security tradeoffs documented for production decision

#### 4. Order Status Flow (7 Required States)
```
pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí preparing ‚Üí ready ‚Üí served ‚Üí completed
‚Üì
cancelled
```

#### 5. Real-time WebSocket Architecture (ADR-004)
- Single connection per client
- Restaurant-scoped events
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Heartbeat every 30s

### Current Quality Baseline (Oct 16, 2025)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 1
- **ESLint Errors**: 12
- **ESLint Warnings**: 477
- **Test Coverage**: ~23.47%
- **Bundle Target**: Main chunk <100KB

## ü§ñ AGENT CONFIGURATIONS

### AGENT 1: Multi-Tenancy Guardian

**Mission**: Detect data isolation violations that could expose restaurant data across tenants.

**Detection Patterns**:
- Database queries without `.eq('restaurant_id', ...)`
- API endpoints missing `req.user.restaurant_id` validation
- RLS policies that are incomplete or missing
- Hardcoded restaurant IDs in code
- Restaurant context not passed through React component trees
- WebSocket events without restaurant scoping
- Supabase admin client used where user client should be

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: server/src/routes/*.routes.ts (API endpoints)
Priority 2: server/src/services/*.ts (business logic)
Priority 3: client/src/contexts/*.tsx (state management)
Priority 4: supabase/migrations/*.sql (RLS policies)
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `from\(.*\)` - Find database queries
- `select\(` , `insert\(`, `update\(`, `delete\(` - Database operations
- `req\.user` - Authentication context
- `restaurant_id` - Check for proper usage

**Critical Checks**:
1. Every Supabase query has restaurant_id filter
2. Every mutation endpoint validates restaurant ownership
3. Every RLS policy includes restaurant_id
4. No cross-tenant data leakage possible

**Severity Scoring**:
- **CRITICAL (P0)**: Query without restaurant_id filter that exposes data
- **HIGH (P1)**: API endpoint without restaurant_id validation
- **MEDIUM (P2)**: Missing RLS policy (app-layer still protects)
- **LOW (P3)**: Restaurant context not propagated (no data exposure)

**Report File**: `reports/scans/{timestamp}/01-multi-tenancy-guardian.md`

---

### AGENT 2: Security & Authentication Auditor

**Mission**: Identify security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and authentication weaknesses.

**Detection Patterns**:
- API keys or secrets in client code
- SQL injection vulnerabilities (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- CORS misconfigurations
- Missing authentication checks on protected endpoints
- Sensitive data in localStorage beyond dual auth pattern
- JWT tokens not properly validated
- Rate limiting gaps
- PII in logs or error messages
- Insecure password/PIN handling (missing bcrypt, no rate limits)
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Secrets in environment variables exposed to client

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: server/src/middleware/auth*.ts (authentication)
Priority 2: server/src/routes/*.routes.ts (endpoint security)
Priority 3: client/src/**/*.tsx (client-side security)
Priority 4: .env files, config files (secrets)
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `localStorage\.setItem`, `localStorage\.getItem` - Check what's stored
- `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_` - Client-exposed env vars
- `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `TOKEN` - Potential secrets
- `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` - XSS vectors
- `\$\{.*\}.*query`, `"SELECT.*\+` - SQL injection
- `cors`, `Access-Control` - CORS config

**Critical Checks**:
1. No secrets in client bundle
2. All parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
3. All protected endpoints have auth middleware
4. CORS only allows known origins
5. PII redacted from logs
6. Rate limiting on auth endpoints
7. CSRF tokens on state-changing operations

**References**:
- docs/SECURITY.md
- docs/AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ADR-006 (Dual Authentication)
- OWASP Top 10

**Severity Scoring**:
- **CRITICAL (P0)**: Secrets exposed, SQL injection, authentication bypass
- **HIGH (P1)**: XSS vulnerability, missing auth checks, PII exposure
- **MEDIUM (P2)**: Missing rate limits, weak CORS, localStorage risks
- **LOW (P3)**: Security headers missing, minor hardening opportunities

**Report File**: `reports/scans/{timestamp}/02-security-auditor.md`

---

### AGENT 3: TypeScript & Type Safety Enforcer

**Mission**: Eliminate type errors and enforce strict TypeScript usage.

**Detection Patterns**:
- Usage of `any` type (explicit or implicit)
- Missing return types on functions
- Type assertions (`as`) that could be avoided
- `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` comments
- Untyped props in React components
- Missing interface definitions for API responses
- Type mismatches between client/server contracts
- Shared types not being imported from `/shared`
- Loose type guards (typeof checks that could be more specific)
- Optional chaining overuse (hiding type issues)

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: shared/types/*.ts (type definitions)
Priority 2: server/src/routes/*.routes.ts (API contracts)
Priority 3: client/src/modules/**/*.tsx (feature modules)
Priority 4: *.ts, *.tsx everywhere (comprehensive scan)
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `: any` - Explicit any types
- `as any` - Type assertions
- `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error` - Type suppression
- `function.*\(` without `:.*=>` - Missing return types
- `interface`, `type ` - Check for existing types

**Critical Checks**:
1. Zero usage of `any` type
2. All functions have explicit return types
3. API types match between client/server
4. React component props are typed
5. Shared types used consistently
6. No @ts-ignore (fix the actual issue)

**References**:
- shared/types/ - Existing type definitions
- shared/api-types.ts - API contracts
- ADR-001 - snake_case in types

**Severity Scoring**:
- **CRITICAL (P0)**: Type errors preventing compilation
- **HIGH (P1)**: `any` type in critical paths (auth, payments, orders)
- **MEDIUM (P2)**: Missing return types, loose type guards
- **LOW (P3)**: Type assertions that work but could be better

**Report File**: `reports/scans/{timestamp}/03-typescript-enforcer.md`

- Missing database indexes
- Inefficient loops or algorithms
- Memory leaks (missing cleanup in useEffect)
- WebSocket connection leaks
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Bundle size violations (main chunk >100KB)
- Synchronous operations that could be async

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: client/src/modules/**/*.tsx (large feature components)
Priority 2: server/src/services/*.ts (database operations)
Priority 3: vite.config.ts (bundle configuration)
Priority 4: client/src/components/**/*.tsx (reusable components)
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `useState`, `useEffect` - React hooks analysis
- `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `React\.memo` - Optimization usage
- `map\(`, `filter\(`, `reduce\(` - Loop patterns
- `from\(.*\)\.select` - Database query patterns
- Component files >500 lines - Size analysis

**Critical Checks**:
1. Main bundle chunk <100KB
2. No N+1 queries in API endpoints
3. Expensive components use React.memo
4. useEffect has proper cleanup
5. WebSocket connections properly managed
6. Database queries use indexes
7. Images optimized/lazy loaded

**References**:
- vite.config.ts - Bundle configuration
- ADR-004 - WebSocket architecture
- Manual chunks MUST be enabled (per CLAUDE.md)

**Severity Scoring**:
- **CRITICAL (P0)**: Bundle size exceeded, memory leaks in production
- **HIGH (P1)**: N+1 queries, missing cleanup, major re-render issues
- **MEDIUM (P2)**: Missing memoization on expensive operations
- **LOW (P3)**: Minor optimizations, premature optimization opportunities

**Report File**: `reports/scans/{timestamp}/04-performance-hunter.md`

- Missing error case tests
- Untested edge cases
- Test files that don't match implementation
- Missing integration tests for APIs
- E2E gaps (beyond existing voice/KDS tests)
- Mock data inconsistent with real data
- Tests that don't assert meaningful behavior
- Flaky tests (intermittent failures)
- Missing test utilities causing duplication

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: server/src/routes/*.routes.ts ‚Üí Check for /__tests__/*.test.ts
Priority 2: server/src/services/*.ts ‚Üí Check for tests
Priority 3: client/src/modules/**/‚Üí Check for tests
Priority 4: Critical user flows (auth, orders, payments)
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `describe\(`, `it\(`, `test\(` - Test structure

- Existing tests in server/src/routes/__tests__/

**Severity Scoring**:
- **CRITICAL (P0)**: Zero tests for payment/auth/order critical paths
- **HIGH (P1)**: Missing error case tests for production features
- **MEDIUM (P2)**: Low coverage on important but non-critical features
- **LOW (P3)**: Missing tests for utility functions, minor gaps

**Report File**: `reports/scans/{timestamp}/05-test-coverage-analyst.md`

### AGENT 6: Convention & Consistency Enforcer

**Mission**: Ensure codebase follows established conventions and ADRs.

**Detection Patterns**:
- camelCase in API payloads (violates ADR-001)
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- camelCase in database queries or Supabase calls
- Transformation functions between snake_case/camelCase (shouldn't exist)

- Unused imports/variables
- Magic numbers without constants
- Hardcoded strings that should be constants
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed quotation styles
- Inconsistent async/await vs .then()

**Scanning Strategy**:
```
Priority 1: server/src/routes/*.routes.ts (API payloads)
Priority 2: All .ts/.tsx files (naming conventions)
Priority 3: Import statements (organization)
Priority 4: Constants and configuration
```

**Grep Patterns**:
- `camelCase` patterns in API responses
