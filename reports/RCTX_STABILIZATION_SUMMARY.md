# RCTX Stabilization Summary

## Executive Summary

Completed post-merge stabilization for restaurant context (rctx) auth enforcement. Fixed critical AI runtime crash, resolved HIGH security vulnerability, and added test coverage for auth middleware.

## PRs Opened

1. **fix(ai): stabilize realtime-menu-tools (args crash)** - https://github.com/mikeyoung304/July25/pull/24
   - Fixed runtime crashes caused by `args` vs `_args` parameter mismatch
   - Added micro test to prevent regression

2. **chore(sec): bump axios (HIGH DoS)** - https://github.com/mikeyoung304/July25/pull/25
   - Resolved HIGH severity DoS vulnerability in axios (transitive dependency)
   - Updated from 1.11.0 to latest version

3. **test(auth): rctx middleware + route guards** - https://github.com/mikeyoung304/July25/pull/26
   - Added middleware tests for validateRestaurantAccess
   - Added route guard consistency tests
   - Found 3 files with legacy imports needing cleanup

## Artifacts

### TypeScript & Linting
- `reports/ts-errors-server.txt` - 186 TS errors (down from 670+)
- `reports/eslint-server.txt` - 31 errors, 196 warnings

### Test Results
- `reports/test-realtime-tools.txt` - ‚úÖ Tests pass (args fix verified)
- `reports/test-validateRestaurantAccess.txt` - ‚úÖ 3 passing tests
- `reports/test-route-guards.txt` - Found legacy imports in 3 files

### Security & RLS
- `reports/npm-audit-after-axios.txt` - HIGH vuln resolved, only 2 low remain
- `reports/rls-status.txt` - Unable to verify (database connection not available from local)

### Staging Verification
- `reports/tenancy-staging.txt` - 3 failures (staging returning 500 errors)
- `reports/tenancy-verifier-result.json` - Detailed test results

## Pass/Fail Status

### ‚úÖ PASSED
- **AI crash fixed**: `args` references corrected in realtime-menu-tools.ts + test present
- **Axios HIGH resolved**: Updated to latest version, HIGH DoS vulnerability removed
- **rctx tests added**: Middleware and route guard tests implemented and passing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **RLS verification**: Unable to verify directly - requires database access or Dashboard check
- **Staging verifier**: Server returning 500 errors - may need deployment or config fix

### üìã FINDINGS
- Current `validateRestaurantAccess` middleware is simple - only sets restaurantId from header
- Full 400/403 enforcement (RESTAURANT_CONTEXT_MISSING/RESTAURANT_ACCESS_DENIED) not yet implemented
- 3 route files still using legacy restaurantAccess imports
- Staging API appears to have issues (500 errors on all auth endpoints)

## Next Steps

To fully complete rctx enforcement:
1. Deploy fixes from the 3 PRs
2. Implement full restaurant membership checking in validateRestaurantAccess
3. Clean up legacy imports in orders.routes.ts, payments.routes.ts, terminal.routes.ts
4. Verify RLS status through Supabase Dashboard or from server with DB access
5. Fix staging deployment issues causing 500 errors
