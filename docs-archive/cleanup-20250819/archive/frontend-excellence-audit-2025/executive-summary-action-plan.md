## ‚ö° Critical Success Factors

### **1. Dependency-First Implementation**
**Foundation MUST be completed first** - Memory leaks and security issues block all other improvements. Service layer depends on foundation. Experience layer depends on service layer.

### **2. Risk-Weighted Execution**  
Start with zero-risk improvements parallel to critical fixes. Validate each phase before proceeding. Maintain rollback capability at all stages.

### **3. Business Value Focus**
Every change directly improves kitchen efficiency, accessibility compliance, or operational reliability. Track ROI at each milestone.

### **4. Expert Validation**
- **Week 4**: Kitchen staff user acceptance testing
- **Week 4**: Professional accessibility audit  
- **Week 6**: Performance engineering validation
- **Week 8**: Comprehensive system validation

## üö® Implementation Risks & Mitigation

### **High-Risk Items** (Require Careful Management)
1. **WebSocket Architecture Changes** - Could destabilize real-time features
   - *Mitigation*: Feature flags, gradual rollout, automatic rollback
   
2. **Kitchen Workflow Algorithm Changes** - May disrupt operations
   - *Mitigation*: A/B testing, staff training, performance monitoring
   
3. **Security Framework Updates** - Could break authentication
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, staged deployment, backup systems

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
