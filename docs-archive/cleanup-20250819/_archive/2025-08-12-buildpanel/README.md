# BuildPanel Integration Archive

**Archive Date:** August 12, 2025

## Why These Documents Were Archived

These documents were archived as part of the complete removal of BuildPanel integration from the Rebuild 6.0 Restaurant OS. BuildPanel was an external AI service that handled voice transcription, order processing, and AI chat functionality.

## What Changed

- **Removed:** All BuildPanel integration code, configuration, and documentation
- **Architecture:** Transitioned to fully internal AI modules integrated directly into the unified Express backend
- **API:** Public REST endpoints (`/api/v1/*` and `/api/v1/ai/*`) remain unchanged - only the internal implementation changed

## New Documentation Location

For current architecture and AI integration documentation, see:

- [README.md](../../../README.md) - Updated quickstart and architecture overview
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md) - Current unified backend architecture
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](../../../DEPLOYMENT.md) - Updated deployment instructions
