## 🚨 Critical Issues (P0) - Immediate Action Required

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Test token authentication bypass** in production (`/server/src/middleware/auth.ts:36-45`)
- **API keys exposed** in repository (OpenAI, Supabase service keys)
- **Missing RLS policies** - complete data isolation failure risk
- **WebSocket authentication weakness** - potential unauthorized access

### 2. **TypeScript Compilation Failures**
- **340+ type errors** blocking CI/CD pipeline
- **Property naming conflicts** (snake_case vs camelCase)
- **Missing type exports** causing module resolution failures
- **Browser API usage** in shared modules

### 3. **Database Security & Performance**
- **No Row Level Security** policies implemented
- **Missing critical indexes** causing slow queries
- **N+1 query patterns** in order processing
- **No connection pooling** configured

### 4. **Voice System Performance**
- **TTFP 800ms** vs 500ms target (60% over limit)
- **Memory leaks** in audio pipeline (31 uncleaned timers)
- **No connection pre-warming** adding 200-300ms latency

## 📈 High Priority Issues (P1)

### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Bundle Size**: 1.27MB main bundle (5x industry standard)
2. **No code splitting** implemented
3. **Test coverage**: Only 15-20% actual coverage
4. **33 failing client tests**, all server tests broken

### Dependency Issues
1. **OpenAI SDK version mismatch** (v4 vs v5)
2. **Security vulnerability** in esbuild chain
3. **Multiple package-lock.json** files causing conflicts
