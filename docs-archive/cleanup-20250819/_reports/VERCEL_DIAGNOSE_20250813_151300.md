# Vercel Build Diagnosis Report
**Date**: 2025-08-13 15:13:00
**Branch**: 86BP-phase2-openai

## Executive Summary
✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: Conflicting `vercel.json` in repository root was overriding Vercel project settings.

## Assumptions vs Reality

| Assumption | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Vercel Root Directory = client | ❌ | Root vercel.json was overriding this setting |
| Include outside root = enabled | ❓ | Cannot verify without UI screenshot, but likely correct |
| Root vercel.json not overriding | ❌ | **Found conflicting root vercel.json** |
| shared/index.ts present & tracked | ✅ | File exists and is tracked in git |
| Aliases resolve to ../shared/index.ts | ✅ | Both vite.config.ts and tsconfig.app.json correctly configured |
| Local client build succeeds | ✅ | Build successful after removing root vercel.json |

## Evidence

### 1. Repository Structure
```
rebuild-6.0/
├── client/           ✅ Frontend app
├── server/           ✅ Backend app  
├── shared/           ✅ Shared types module
│   └── index.ts      ✅ Main export file (exists)
├── vercel.json       ❌ CONFLICTING (removed)
└── client/
    └── vercel.json   ✅ Correct config location
```

### 2. Conflicting vercel.json Files

#### Root vercel.json (PROBLEMATIC - NOW REMOVED)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm install && cd client && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install --workspaces",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Issues**:
- Overrides Vercel's "Root Directory: client" setting
- Forces build from repo root instead of client directory
- Makes `../shared` resolution fail during Vercel build

#### Client vercel.json (CORRECT)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
**This is correct** - paths are relative to client directory.

### 3. Alias Configuration (CORRECT)

#### vite.config.ts (line 22)
```typescript
'@rebuild/shared': path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared/index.ts'),
```

#### tsconfig.app.json (lines 42-43)
```json
"@rebuild/shared": ["../shared/index.ts"],
"@rebuild/shared/*": ["../shared/*"]
```

Both configurations correctly point to the file, not just the directory.

### 4. Build Test Results
```bash
✓ 2329 modules transformed.
✓ built in 4.07s
```
Local build succeeds perfectly after removing conflicting root vercel.json.

## Diff Summary

### Changes Made
1. **Removed root vercel.json** - This file was overriding Vercel project settings
   ```diff
   - vercel.json (at root)
   ```

## What to Verify in Vercel UI After This Commit

1. **Project Settings** → **General**
   - Confirm "Root Directory" is set to `client`
   - Confirm "Include files outside the root directory" is ENABLED

2. **Build & Development Settings**
   - Build Command should be: `npm run build` (not the complex command from root vercel.json)
   - Output Directory should be: `dist`
   - Install Command can be default or `npm ci`

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all VITE_* variables are present
   - VITE_API_BASE should point to your backend

## User Confirmation Needed

Please provide screenshots of:

1. **Vercel → july25-client → Settings → General**
   - Show Root Directory setting
   - Show "Include files outside the root directory" toggle

2. **Vercel → july25-client → Settings → Build & Development**  
   - Show any Production Overrides if present

3. **GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions**
   - Confirm presence of VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (values hidden)

## Next Steps

1. Commit the removal of root vercel.json
2. Push to trigger Vercel deployment
3. Monitor build logs to confirm success
4. If build still fails, check Vercel UI for any Production Overrides that might be interfering

## Conclusion

The primary issue was a **conflicting root-level vercel.json** that was overriding the Vercel project's "Root Directory: client" setting. This caused the build to run from the wrong location, making `../shared` imports fail. Removing this file should resolve the build issues.
