## Problem Areas Ranked by Impact

### 🔴 Critical (Blocking >30 tests each)
1. **UnifiedCartContext Mocking** - 40 tests blocked
   - Root: Mock structure doesn't export context, only hook
   - Impact: All checkout/cart integration tests
   - Fix Effort: Medium (2-3 hours)

2. **Browser API Polyfills** - 30 tests blocked
   - Root: MediaRecorder/Audio APIs not in JSDOM
   - Impact: All voice module tests
   - Fix Effort: Low (add polyfill package)

### 🟡 High (Blocking 20-30 tests)
3. **Component API Evolution** - 25 tests blocked
   - Root: Tests reference old component signatures
   - Impact: KDS, Orders, Error components
   - Fix Effort: Medium (update test props)

4. **Service Layer Alignment** - 30 tests blocked
   - Root: Services changed, tests didn't update
   - Impact: OrderService, WebSocket, data hooks
   - Fix Effort: High (requires test rewrites)

### 🟢 Medium (Blocking <20 tests)
5. **Timer/Async Handling** - 12 tests blocked
   - Root: Race conditions in time-dependent tests
   - Impact: ElapsedTimer, accessibility tests
   - Fix Effort: Low (add proper awaits)

## Restoration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days, +42 tests)
```
Priority | Task                          | Tests | Effort
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   1     | Add MediaRecorder polyfill    |  +30  | 2 hours
   2     | Fix timer async handling      |  +12  | 3 hours

Expected Result: 356/430 passing (83%)
```

### Phase 2: Medium Effort (3-5 days, +65 tests)
```
Priority | Task                          | Tests | Effort
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   3     | Fix UnifiedCartContext mock   |  +40  | 1 day
   4     | Update component API tests    |  +25  | 2 days

Expected Result: 421/430 passing (98%)
```

### Phase 3: Hard Work (1-2 weeks, +9 tests)
```
Priority | Task                          | Tests | Effort
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   5     | Rewrite service layer tests   |  +9   | 2 weeks

Expected Result: 430/430 passing (100%)
```

## Historical Trend
```
The "164 tests passing" claim only counted SERVER tests.

What we actually have:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Server Tests:    164/165  (99%)   🟢  │
│ Client Tests:    150/287  (52%)   🟡  │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────  │
│ TOTAL:          314/430  (73%)    🟡  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Quarantine list indicates technical debt from:
- Rapid feature development without test updates
- Context/provider refactoring without mock updates
- Component API evolution
- Adding voice features without browser API mocks
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
- [ ] Update public claims to "314 tests passing (73%)"
- [ ] Add MediaRecorder polyfill to test environment
- [ ] Fix 12 timer/async tests with proper awaits
- [ ] Document UnifiedCartContext mock requirements

### Short-Term (This Month)
- [ ] Fix UnifiedCartContext mock structure (40 tests)
- [ ] Update component API tests (25 tests)
- [ ] Add CI check to prevent quarantine list growth
- [ ] Create pre-commit hook for placeholder test detection

### Long-Term (This Quarter)
- [ ] Rewrite service layer tests (30 tests)
- [ ] Achieve 95%+ pass rate
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement test quality gates in CI

## Key Insights

### ✅ What's Working
- Server security tests are comprehensive and high-quality
- Client hook tests are well-written and all passing
- No widespread use of fake/placeholder tests
- Tests that pass are genuinely testing behavior
- Test infrastructure (Vitest, Testing Library) is solid

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention
- 31% of tests in quarantine (technical debt)
- Context mocking patterns need standardization
- Tests fell behind during rapid feature development
- Some tests may never have worked in CI
- Browser API mocking incomplete

### 📈 Path Forward
**Goal:** 94% passing (405/430 tests) within 2 weeks

**Strategy:**
1. Quick wins first (polyfills, async fixes)
2. Then tackle context mocking systematically
3. Component updates in parallel
4. Service layer rewrites as final phase

**Success Criteria:**
- <20 tests in quarantine list
- All quarantined tests have tracked issues
- New tests can't be added without passing
- CI fails if quarantine list grows

---

## Summary

The test suite is **BETTER** than the "164 tests" claim suggests (314 passing), but **NEEDS WORK** to restore quarantined tests (137 blocked). The path to 94% is clear and achievable with focused effort on mocking patterns and API updates.

**Current State:** 🟡 Moderate Health (73% passing)
**Achievable Target:** 🟢 Good Health (94% passing) in 2 weeks
**Stretch Goal:** 🟢 Excellent Health (98%+ passing) in 1 month
