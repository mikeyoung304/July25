# Phase 2: Quick Wins Summary (Phases 2.1-2.3)

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Initial Status**: 18/36 files passing (50%)
**Final Status**: 18/36 files passing (50%)
**Net Gain**: +1 file fully fixed, but 4 files revealed to need deeper work

---

## Executive Summary

Attempted to fix 8 files across 3 "Quick Win" phases. **Only 1 file was fully fixed**. The remaining 7 files were initially misdiagnosed - they require moderate to complex fixes, not simple changes.

### Key Discovery
**Most quarantined tests were mislabeled**. Issues originally categorized as:
- ❌ "Router context issues" → Actually complex UnifiedCartContext mocking
- ❌ "Supabase auth mocks" → Actually timer/async handling problems
- ❌ "Import/path issues" → Actually component API mismatches

---

## Phase 2.1: Import/Path Issues (3 files)

### Goal
Fix tests with incorrect import paths or missing dependencies.

### Results: ✅ 1/3 Fixed

#### ✅ FIXED: `src/modules/floor-plan/components/__tests__/chip-monkey.test.tsx`
**Issue**: Missing React import for JSX
**Fix**: Added `import React from 'react'`
**Status**: All 4 tests passing ✅

#### ❌ RE-QUARANTINED: `src/modules/kitchen/components/__tests__/KDSOrderCard.test.tsx`
**Expected Issue**: Import path wrong
**Actual Issue**: Test props don't match component API
- Test expects: `order` object with `created_at`, `table_number`, etc.
- Component signature mismatch
**Diagnosis**: Needs full test rewrite, not import fix

#### ❌ RE-QUARANTINED: `src/modules/orders/components/__tests__/OrderCard.test.tsx`
**Expected Issue**: Import path wrong
**Actual Issue**: Test props don't match component API
- Test provides: individual props (orderNumber, tableNumber, items, status)
- Component expects: `order: Order` object
**Diagnosis**: Needs full test rewrite, not import fix

---

## Phase 2.2: Router Context Issues (4 files)

### Goal
Add MemoryRouter wrappers to fix "useNavigate must be used within RouterProvider" errors.

### Results: ❌ 0/4 Fixed

**Critical Discovery**: These weren't router issues at all!

### Infrastructure Improvements Made:
1. **`client/test/setup.ts`**: Added missing `VITE_DEFAULT_RESTAURANT_ID` env variable
2. **`checkout-simple.test.tsx`**: Fixed `vi.requireActual` → `vi.importActual` (Vitest API)
3. **`CheckoutPage.demo.test.tsx`**:
   - Added React import
   - Changed `BrowserRouter` → `MemoryRouter`
   - Fixed named → default imports
4. **`checkout.e2e.test.tsx`**: Fixed named → default imports

### Actual Root Cause: Complex UnifiedCartContext Mocking

All 4 files fail with:
```
Error: [vitest] No "UnifiedCartContext" export is defined on the
"@/contexts/UnifiedCartContext" mock. Did you forget to return it from "vi.mock"?
```

**Problem**:
- Current mocks only export `useUnifiedCart` hook
- Tests need `UnifiedCartContext` itself for provider setup
- Requires proper context architecture mocking

#### ❌ RE-QUARANTINED (all 4):
- `src/modules/order-system/__tests__/checkout-simple.test.tsx`
- `src/modules/order-system/__tests__/checkout.e2e.test.tsx`
- `src/modules/order-system/context/CartContext.test.tsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/CheckoutPage.demo.test.tsx`

**New Category**: "Complex context mocking issues (NOT quick wins)"

---

## Phase 2.3: Supabase Auth Mocks (1 file)

### Goal
Fix Supabase client mocking in AuthContext tests.

### Results: ⚠️ Partial (1/3 tests passing)

#### File: `src/contexts/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`

**Fix Applied**: Added `import React from 'react'`

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Test 1: "should clear refresh timer on unmount" - **PASSING**
- ❌ Test 2: "should schedule single refresh timer..." - **TIMEOUT (15s)**
- ❌ Test 3: "should prevent concurrent refresh attempts..." - **TIMEOUT (15s)**

**Root Issue**: Tests use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and expect async operations to complete when advancing timers. The token refresh logic isn't cooperating with fake timers.

**Diagnosis**: Requires deep investigation into timer/async handling patterns. Not a simple mock issue.

#### ❌ RE-QUARANTINED
**New Category**: "Partial fix: Added React import (1/3 tests passing, 2 timing out)"

---

## Infrastructure Improvements

Even though we didn't fix many tests, we made valuable improvements:

### 1. Environment Variables (`client/test/setup.ts`)
```typescript
process.env.VITE_DEFAULT_RESTAURANT_ID = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
```
**Impact**: All tests now have required env vars

### 2. Vitest API Corrections
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect):
vi.requireActual('react-router-dom')

// NEW (correct):
await vi.importActual('react-router-dom')
```
**Impact**: Proper async module mocking

### 3. Test Isolation
Changed `BrowserRouter` → `MemoryRouter` in tests for better isolation.

### 4. Documentation
Updated `tests/quarantine.list` with:
- Accurate issue descriptions
- Phase findings sections
- Notes on what was tried

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Initial Diagnosis Was Too Optimistic
Most "Quick Wins" were actually:
- **Moderate complexity**: Context mocking architecture
- **Complex**: Timer/async handling, component rewrites

### 2. Test Quality Issues
Many tests have fundamental problems:
- Tests written for different component signatures
- Mock architectures don't match actual usage patterns
- Timer-dependent tests without proper fake timer setup

### 3. Value of Investigation
Even failed fix attempts revealed:
- True root causes
- Infrastructure gaps (missing env vars)
- API misuses (vi.requireActual)

---

## Current Test Suite Status

```
Total Files: 36
Passing: 18 (50%)
Quarantined: 18 (50%)

Tests: 150 passing
```

### Quarantine Breakdown by Complexity:

#### Simple (React imports only):
- ✅ FIXED: chip-monkey.test.tsx

#### Moderate:
- Context mocking: 4 files (checkout/cart tests)
- Component API mismatches: 2 files (OrderCard tests)
- API service mocks: 2 files
- MediaRecorder/Audio mocks: 4 files
- Accessibility: 1 file

#### Complex:
- Timer/async: 4 files (AuthContext, ElapsedTimer, WebSocket, realtime)
- React 18 ErrorBoundary: 1 file

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Accept 50% as baseline** - Remaining issues need focused engineering time
2. **Prioritize by impact** - Fix tests for most-used components first
3. **Consider test deletion** - Some tests may be testing wrong things

### Medium Term
1. **Context Mocking Pattern** - Create reusable mock setup for UnifiedCartContext
2. **Timer Test Guidelines** - Document proper fake timer usage patterns
3. **Component Test Standards** - Ensure tests match actual component APIs

### Long Term
1. **Test Architecture Review** - Many tests need complete rewrites
2. **Mock Strategy** - Establish consistent mocking patterns
3. **CI Integration** - Run passing tests on every commit

## Files Modified This Session

### Fixed:
- `client/src/modules/floor-plan/components/__tests__/chip-monkey.test.tsx`

### Improved (but still failing):
- `client/src/modules/order-system/__tests__/checkout-simple.test.tsx`
- `client/src/modules/order-system/__tests__/checkout.e2e.test.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/__tests__/CheckoutPage.demo.test.tsx`
- `client/src/contexts/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`

### Infrastructure:
- `client/test/setup.ts` - Added VITE_DEFAULT_RESTAURANT_ID
- `client/tests/quarantine.list` - Updated with accurate descriptions

---

## Next Steps

If continuing with test fixes:

1. **High ROI** - Fix UnifiedCartContext mocking (unlocks 4 files)
2. **Medium ROI** - Fix component API mismatches (2 files)
3. **Low ROI** - Complex timer/async issues (requires deep investigation)

If deprioritizing test fixes:
1. Document current state as acceptable baseline
2. Focus on feature development
3. Fix tests opportunistically when touching related code
