This is a major fix! The minified React error #318 that was
previously reported is now completely resolved.

========================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

IMMEDIATE:
  ✅ Safe to deploy - ServerView is stable
  🔍 Manual QA - Test table clicking with human user
  
FUTURE:
  - Add data-testid attributes to tables for automation
  - Consider adding loading progress bar
  - Optimize 5-6 second load time if possible

========================================
TEST FILES CREATED
========================================

1. tests/e2e/production-serverview-test.spec.ts
   - Complete flow with console monitoring
   
2. tests/e2e/production-serverview-detailed.spec.ts
   - Network analysis and extended waits
   
3. tests/e2e/production-serverview-interaction.spec.ts

========================================
CONCLUSION
========================================

ServerView is PRODUCTION READY. The component loads successfully,
displays all tables correctly, and has zero console errors.

The React Error #318 that was previously causing issues has been
