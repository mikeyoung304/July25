# Phase 1 Report: Critical Unblocks

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: Discovery & Baselines ✅
- Recorded baseline metrics: 791 TypeScript errors, 1264 ESLint errors
- Test pass rate: 80.87% (258 passed, 61 failed)
- Created audit directory structure

### Phase 1A: API Contract Alignment ✅
- Applied `normalizeCasing` middleware globally to server
- Middleware now processes all API routes automatically
- Imported canonical types from shared/types
- Provides backward compatibility for snake_case→camelCase

### Phase 1B: Vitest Compatibility Shim ✅
- Strengthened Jest→Vitest compatibility layer
- Added globalThis.jest alias for broader support
- Added TypeScript ignore comments
- Tests still have same pass rate (migration incomplete)

### Phase 1C: Order Field Validation ✅
- Confirmed required fields: price, subtotal, tax, total
- Added comprehensive test suite (6 tests, all passing)
- Tests validate positive values and field transformation
- Tip defaults to 0 when not provided

### Phase 2A: KDS Status Handling ✅
- Fixed StationStatusBar missing 'cancelled' case
- Fixed useTableGrouping hook for all 7 statuses
- Added default fallbacks with console warnings
- Prevents runtime errors from missing status checks

## Metrics After Phase 1

- TypeScript errors: 792 (increased by 1)
- Tests created: 6 new passing tests for order validation
- Files modified: 5
- Commits: 5

## Next Steps (Phase 2B)
- Stabilize voice hooks to prevent reconnection loops
- Add exponential backoff with jitter
- Use refs for callbacks to minimize effect dependencies
